    <p>I've recently looked at Ubuntu's 10.04 and 10.10 installers, and they
are quite nifty tools, so fresh and gorgeous, and so easy to use that
nobody would dare say &quot;I can't install Linux!&quot;. And then I recently
re-installed my Debian system and I don't really see how much harder it
is to use than Ubuntu's (except that it's far uglier, so I guess that
also makes it intimidating).</p>
<p>What triggered this post is the following titbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d-i [Debian Installer] is the very first thing many of our users
see, and has a huge range of uses, from simple desktop installs to
massive corporate deployments; it's unspeakably important that it
works well, and it's a testament to its design that it's been able
to trundle along without actually very much serious refactoring for
the best part of five years now.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, this tool (or rather, a set of tools) also happens to be
rock-solid tool, and its great reliability gets admiration from me on
each install (and I've done dozens, with not one instance of data loss).</p>
