    <p>Here's a part-fictional account of events that are largely my fault:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Friend got a new laptop and I elect to install Debian (or whatever OS
I find suitable at that moment) side-by-side with the pre-installed
Windows.</li>
<li>I show Friend around since he finds the interface unfamiliar, and I
get a dry mouth explaining the advantages, while trying hard to avoid
Windows bashing. He sort of agrees.</li>
<li>I upgrade it later on (mainly because I'm hoping the new hotness will
get their wireless networking hardware working).</li>
<li>The upgrade breaks something else in the process, and I spend hours
fixing it...</li>
<li>Only to have them spend their computing lives in Windows since it's
more familiar (as well as the fact the software that came with their
cell-phone doesn't run anywhere else).</li>
<li>We computer 'geniuses' all know that Windows has a nasty habit of
overwriting the boot partition such that an already-installed OS is
no longer bootable, so I gotta come over, to make it bootable again
(and this is made worse by the fact that reinstalls are pretty commom
when Windows gives trouble).</li>
