  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Some years ago, I was totally excited by having <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my first job working on
software</a>. I am very grateful for the chance the owner, who interviewed
me for the position, took on me. I learned an incredible amount of
stuff, though I didn't enjoy much of it (had to do lots of Java among
other ugly things).</p>
<p>Some months ago, a friend enticed me to the idea of doing something
else, giving me contacts for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.embedded-iq.com">some company</a> building software and
electronics products for the mining industry. So I wasn't actually
looking for work, but I was glad of the opportunity since I was sort of
stagnating, and it really looked like this new company did some more fun
stuff, and I got the vibe that I'd really get challenged.</p>
<p>It's been 3 months now, and my guess was right. I keep getting surprised
by the levels of smart I encounter regurlarly. These are the sorts of
people I simply can't match with my lesser brain, but I'm glad to work
with, since I learn so much.</p>
<p>The systems we build are embedded, so I spend most of my time working
with C and C++, and it tends to be a serious challenge, given that
there's a lot less hand-holding with those than with my favorite,
Python.</p>
