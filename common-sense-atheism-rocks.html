    <p>I've read dozens of posts by <a class="reference external" href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=12">Luke Muehlhauser</a> at his <a class="reference external" href="http://commonsenseatheism.com">Common Sense
Atheism</a> site, among the best blogs I've read ever, which also happens
to be the first and only atheism blog I regularly read. The guy
regularly manages to enthrall me with his thorough and very broad
outlook on the topic, managing to put words where I'd fail (or even
sub-topics I wouldn't expect anyone would write about), his intelligence
(EG when debating some real smart theists), the courage of promoting
some <a class="reference external" href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=1924">off-beat ideas</a>, not to mention the quality of much of the
commentary he receives from readers. What makes these even more
impressive is that the guy is in the 1st half of his twenties.</p>
<p>[<strong>sidenote</strong>] My favorite posts are too many, so here's his own links
to <a class="reference external" href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=6086">what he deems most useful</a>. He has also received serious praise
from his other readers (check the comments <a class="reference external" href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=1174">here</a>)</p>
