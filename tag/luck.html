                    <p>Some years ago, I was totally excited by having <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my first job working on
software</a>. I am very grateful for the chance the owner, who interviewed
me for the position, took on me. I learned an incredible amount of
stuff, though I didn't enjoy much of it (had to do lots of Java among
other ugly things).</p>
<p>Some months ago, a friend enticed me to the idea of doing something
else, giving me contacts for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.embedded-iq.com">some company</a> building software and
electronics products for the mining industry. So I wasn't actually
looking for work, but I was glad of the opportunity since I was sort of
stagnating, and it really looked like this new company did some more fun
stuff, and I got the vibe that I'd really get challenged.</p>
<p>It's been 3 months now, and my guess was right. I keep getting surprised
by the levels of smart I encounter regurlarly. These are the sorts of
people I simply can't match with my lesser brain, but I'm glad to work
with, since I learn so much.</p>
<p>The systems we build are embedded, so I spend most of my time working
with C and C++, and it tends to be a serious challenge, given that
there's a lot less hand-holding with those than with my favorite,
Python.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I had one of the most exciting moments in my life when I got offered a
job at a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tauspace.com">software development company</a> (the title is Analyst: Software
Engineering). I don't even know what my planned-for tasks are, and I was
all the more surprised because I think I didn't do well at the
interview. Great news is I didn't expect a coding job so soon,
especially given I don't have previous professional exposure.</p>
<p>I am an electronic technician (lesser than an engineer) by trade and am
pretty unhappy in my current job (testing, calibration, and
fault-finding of gyro-stabilised airborne surveillance/observation
systems). That's partly because I don't really get challenged since I'm
on a production line. I do strongly doubt I'd be job-hunting was I in
development/engineering.</p>
<p>Best of all however is I'll be working on software, a dream job really,
considering I love computers and all, and specifically the software part
of it. Electronics is fine too, but the last time I really got close to
it was back in school, and I'm here talking of design, not &quot;testing,
calibration...&quot;.</p>
<p>How lucky can one get!</p>
