                    </h2>

                    <p>I have been using an Acer TravelMate 6592 laptop for close to 3 years
(ever since I got <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my coding job</a>). It had some issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.co.za/search?hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=630&amp;q=6592+acer&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">it's damn ugly</a>, though not as much as Lenovo ones</li>
<li>it requires Intel non-free firmware for its Wi-Fi chipset</li>
<li>it frequently refused to make the LAN accessible from Linux on boot;
this was likely a BIOS issue</li>
<li>the battery capacity was below 50% so it didn't last</li>
<li>the hard drive was developing bad sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, it truly was an excellent laptop, and I never
complained about its performance, ever since I added a 2GB RAM stick, to
make it a total of 4GB (except that I wished my HDD was faster, tempting
me to buy an SSD). What else I really liked about it is the
feature-packed touchpad: Beyond the normal two-finger and
side-scrolling, it also had up-down-left-right buttons which allowed
constant-speed scrolling. It's interesting that such a touchpad is very
rare.</p>
<p>I now got an HP Probook 4530s and its pros:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=probook+4530s&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=630">it's stunning</a></li>
<li>it's got a real fast hard drive; there were times when I saw speeds
upwards to 70MB/s, which I never saw with the older laptop</li>
<li>its Wi-Fi doesn't require non-free software</li>
<li>it's far more modern (USB3 support) and supposedly faster (Core
i5-2410M vs. Core 2 Duo T7500), but my typical workload made even the
TravelMate more than adequate</li>
</ul>
<p>And the cons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a less featureful touchpad</li>
<li>keyboard keys placed in weird locations (e.g. <strong>pg up</strong> and <strong>pg dn</strong>
buttons are placed far away, at the top-right corner; I blame the
(needless for me) numeric keypad</li>
<li>the screen resolution is on the low side and so is the screen size;
the older laptop is much bigger even if they are both labeled 15.4&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>...and Debian:</p>
<p>Quite a few times, I tend to want to stick to a stable release of
Debian. Following Debian development does take time (frequent updates,
curiosity to see what changed, and something getting broken here and
there). So I tried to do the same here. Sadly, some of the software in
Squeeze is too outdated to be optimal, so am glad to have teams like
<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/thanks-to-the-debian-backports-team">Debian Backports folk</a>. But that wasn't enough, so I ended up
installing Xorg components from Debian Unstable (Suspend doesn't work
well with Squeeze (Debian 6) and backports doesn't have a newer X
version.</p>
<p>Let's see how long I last trying to keep pure by running as little from
outside Squeeze as possible.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>:</p>
<p>This didn't even last for 1 day. I was having issues with my X hanging
the entire OS, forcing me to do a hard-reboot. This happened when I was
watching a video using VLC, so I blamed it and installed the version
from Debian Unstable. Sadly, doing things that way resulted in a VLC
that refused to die normally, forcing me to do <tt class="docutils literal">kill <span class="pre">-9</span> vlc</tt>. I then
just screwed my plans and upgraded fully to Unstable, and now VLC quits
gracefully. Let's see if I'll have the X lockup again.</p>
<p><strong>update 2</strong>:</p>
<p>Well, I still experience machine lock-ups, the bad ones forcing a
hard-reboot. This might be related to Wi-Fi because I used the system
for quite a while using the wired link, without any such lock-up.</p>
<p><strong>update 3</strong>:</p>
<p>No more lock-ups, except very rarely. I run a mix of Testing and
Unstable at the moment, but my &quot;/etc/sources.list&quot; file points solely at
my custom repository and Testing, for it just is tiring to keep tracking
Unstable... way too much bandwidth.</p>

                    <p>Since I've departed from previous job, I've lost access to <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/my-machines">two machines</a>,
but more than made up for it by acquiring an Acer Travelmate 6592,
a feature-rich laptop complete with wireless connectivity (802.11a/b/g),
Bluetooth, card readers, fingerprint scanner, webcam, Firewire,
and even age-old DB9 serial port, while also not being short
on specs (Intel T7500 processor, 2GB DDR2, 250GB HDD).
Even better, unlike those two machines, I also get to take it home.</p>

                    <p>The laptop that <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/my-machines">I previously mentioned</a> is named Compaq/HP nx7010 and
is the most favorite I've ever used (despite that it's only the second
laptop I've ever used heavily). I suspect I like it mostly because of
the feel of the keyboard, and its 1.7GHz Pentium M is really more than
adequate for the modest tasks I throw at it; and its only set-back is
the placement of the 3 USB ports - at the back. It's a pity that I'll
have to leave it behind since <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">I'm changing jobs</a>. I also use an external
USB mouse, which also enhances the experience. [<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/1-more-machine-2-less">update</a>]</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I have, since my first machine in 2004, owned 2 other complete systems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a Dell Inspiron desktop Core 2 Duo (Conroe) system boasting 2GB RAM
and 160GB HDD</li>
<li>a power-hungry and underperfoming Pentium 4 Prescott system
(3.06GHz/1GB RAM)</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently primarily use the old P4 and it's still pretty decent at
2.66GHz and 0.5GB of RAM. It also sports a DVD-Writer and 250GB HDD, all
SATA. The other systems are used by those close to me for one reason or
another.</p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron is my most recent machine. It got 3-year warranty on
it (which was quite a surprise) so I'm not touching its insides. This
system currenly dual-boots with Windows XP which a relative of mine uses
for music production, a task he claims FLOSS can't satisfactorily
fulfill.</p>
<p>I should note the other systems I use at work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An HP Core 2 Duo Conroe 1.86GHz/1GB RAM desktop, my primary workhorse
for building Debian, which dual-boots with Windows XP since it
actually is a shared machine for those I work with in the area (about
a dozen people), and of course a bit over-powered for what is claimed
to be an 'email-checking' and 'printing' machine. I just manage to
find time in-between these email/printing sessions to have it do the
grunt-work.</li>
<li>a recently-acquired Pentium M 1.7GHz/500MB RAM HP/Compaq laptop which
provides quite decent performance too and a claimed battery life of
2+ hrs. This system also dual-boots with Windows XP since nearly all
that we need at work uses it. It's also the system where I do
software/programming study and miscellaneous reading on since it's
the only system at work I have exclusive access to.
[<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/favorite-laptop">expansion/update</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>I've neglected to mention the other 2 systems I'm not interested in,
which I use at work for some work tasks, both Windows-based (and going
as far back as Windows 98!), and both under-powered but pretty
well-suited to their specific tasks (except that I still have to use
micro-floppy diskettes), and also uniteresting because they aren't
running my favorite operating system, Debian.</p>
<p>That's 6 systems in total all running Debian, 3 of which dual-boot with
Windows XP, 1 dual-booting with Windows Vista (the Core 2 laptop), and 2
(including my primary system, mt first) purely Debian. Of these, the
only one with internet access is the desktop HP system at work actually,
mainly because web-access in SA isn't nearly as affordable as I'd like.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I only recently realized that my oldest computer system, the first I
ever bought, has all been renewed, bar the processor, an old-style P4
(Northwood) purchased July 2004.</p>
<p>The original 80GB HDD, which I loved due to high reliability despite
serious punishment (I did so much experimenting with it including
multiple OS installations) until it failed earlier this year.</p>
<p>The motherboard failed several months ago (difficult problems involving
USB connectivity and lack of sound, all intermittent, all resulting in
emotional pain).</p>
<p>The SONY DVD-Writer which I loved due running reliably for years until
it failed earlier this year. I also lost the power supply which kept
resetting when, say for example I was inserting an optical disk and the
HDD was doing much seeking (both of which must have induced unberable
power spikes the PSU), an obvious sign of deterioration, and great
source of emotional pain too.</p>
<p>The replacement included a case as well, so yes, even the case ain't
original.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was initially all PATA (with those fucking annoying IDE
cables) and am all SATA now (luckily the replacement motherboard got 2
SATA ports, which is all I needed since I only got 1 optical drive and 1
HDD).</p>
