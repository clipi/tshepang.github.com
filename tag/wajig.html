                    </h2>

                    <p>Some stuff I might work on in future:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I want to start using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete">argcomplete</a> at some point, a more dynamic
shell completion tool, replacing the current hand-rolled solution.
I find shell programming hard, and argcomplete, which is inspired by
<a class="reference external" href="http://furius.ca/optcomplete/">optcomplete</a> is a brilliant workaround.</li>
<li>Someone asked me to restore gjig, the GUI tool that <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/wajig-21-released">I removed from
wajig</a> some releases ago. This will be an opportunity to learn
GTK+ again. I did a bit of it, even contributing patches (<a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/">Tracker
project</a>), but was never quite confident. It's very likely that I
won't work on this... too much work.</li>
</ul>
<p>But ultimately, I would love for the standard Debian packaging tools
to get the the point where they make wajig irrelvant. After all, wajig
was created to be a wrapper that helps ease the mess.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Here's the work I did in the past working on wajig, have a look at
<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/tag/wajig">its tag</a>. Off the top of my head:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>improved, simplied packaging</li>
<li>port to Python 3</li>
<li>port to argparse (from getopt), which also meant proper handling of
subcommands</li>
<li>increased usage of python-apt, instead of hand-crafted (and ugly)
code</li>
<li>a few feature additions</li>
<li>(lots of) modernising the code</li>
<li>(lots of) cleaning up</li>
</ul>
<p>And over 800 commits later, I am glad.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Unix/Linux systems have a simple (but useful) tool named <cite>which</cite>,
whose main purpose is to indicate where in the filesystem a particular
executable is installed. This functionality was added in Python 3.3,
and though simple, I was looking forward to its availability in
Debian, just so I could replace wajig's own equivalent functionality,
which only checked for file presence, and was hard-coded and therefore
inflexible. <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil#shutil.which">shutil.which()</a>, OTOH, looks for the given executable name
in user's PATH and is more thorough, since it also checks if the
executable name points to something that is actually executable.  So,
making use of this new function resulted in more robust code, as well
as <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/wajig/source/detail?r=e419e439e47f880ab17f6394e3faaa8ce3b15fe1">a lot cleaner</a>.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, this functionality <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue444582">was first proposed in 2001</a>!</p>

                    <p>I once claimed that Debian 7 (Wheezy) will release with version 2.7 of
wajig, but soon after, I noticed that an exception occurs if you run a
command like <tt class="docutils literal">wajig new</tt> if one of the newly-available packages was
available for the configured foreign architecture, but not for the
native one (<a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=679969">bug 679969</a>). To fix that, I released 2.7.1, but I
submitted a dirty tarball for upload, so had to resubmit, ending up
releasing 2.7.2. Later on, someone noticed that <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=681309">a certain subcommand
wasn't recognized</a>, and I released 2.7.3 which fixes the issue.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Version 2.6 of wajig has changes so small that I did not bother writing
about its release, but was nevertheless very important because the
bash-completion now works a lot better than before,
thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/">Reuben Thomas</a>.
I also stopped wajig from accepting UPPERCASE subcommands,
since a few people on the mailing list expressed dislike,
and that includes project founder.</p>
<p>Version 2.7, the version that will be in the next stable release of
Debian [<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/debian-7-will-release-with-wajig-273">update</a>], Wheezy (Debian 7), fixes two bugs, one of which I
sort of intentionally broke in order to fix some issues with the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--simulate</span></tt> and/or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--teaching</span></tt> options.
Someone <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.debian.org/670687">did complain about this</a> which was good since it's a good
indicator that someone actually cared about the feature.
That motivated me to fix it,
and I ensured that the fix was in before Debian 7 freeze.</p>
<p>This work is my greatest contribution for this upcoming Debian
release.</p>

                    <p>The release of <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/wajig-23-released">wajig 2.3</a>, though important to me, caused varius
complaints because it changed much of the UI. 2.5 goes a long way
towards fixing those. What particularly helped guide this release is my
creating a <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/wajig">mailing list</a>, just so that I can ask users for opinions on
whether or not to do this or that change. There was much feedback and
complaints of course, sometimes to a point where I felt like I'm just
messing up, as in not helping make the world a better place. Luckily
there were also words of appreciation of my efforts in maintaining it.</p>

                    <p>Less than a week after releasing 2.3, someone discovered a bug when
running the NEW subcommand. All wajig did was fall flat with an ugly
exception, making this some sort of emergency release. Anyways, I
already had some nice improvements, so I released those as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The INSTALL subcommand can now be given a mixture of filenames, .deb
files, and normal package names, and will be able to install the
packages specified. Previously, only one of these 3 types could be
installed at a time.</li>
<li>Apparently the reasons I gave for removing the —simulate and
—teaching (now renamed to —teach) options in 2.3 weren't good enough,
so I reinstated them.</li>
<li>The bash completer now completes both lower-case and upper-case
subcommands, thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/">Reuben Thomas</a>, an avid wajig user.</li>
<li>There's a few other changes, so <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20120327T130420Z.html">here's the gory details</a>.</li>

                    </h2>

                    <p>It's been many months since wajig was released, but this was about as
good as any since I probably did far more work on it than on any other
release so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The most user-visible change is that I changed the UI to feel more
standard/natural, where each of the wajig COMMANDS are 1st-class
citizens. Let me give an example of user wanting to install a package
named nautilus, but avoid installing its Recommends depencencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># ole</span>
wajig —norecommends INSTALL nautilus
<span class="c"># new</span>
wajig INSTALL —norecommends nautilus
</pre></div>
<p>I call this natural because it makes more sense to have the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--norecommends</span></tt> command line option to be specified <em>after</em> the
(wajig) subcommand it modifies. Also, the way it was implemented
previously, the option would silently be ignored if it was used in a
case where it was irrelevant. That's not good, and it links to the
next user-visible change.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There is less magic and more strictness. Previously, these commands
resulted in the same outcome:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wajig REMOVEORPHANS
wajig REMOVE-ORPHANS
wajig R-____EMOVE-ORPH----___AN_S
</pre>
<p>What wajig did was simply sanitise the commands, getting rid of the
junk. Well, I don't like that, but since I didn't want to break
people's commands/aliases/scripts I actually tried to preserve that
functionality, but argparse didn't let me do that, and messing around
with <tt class="docutils literal">sys.argv</tt> before argparse jumped in was an error-prone mess,
which links us to the next change, this time behind-the-scenes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I replaced the archaic <tt class="docutils literal">getopt</tt> CLI parser with a far more powerful
<tt class="docutils literal">argparse</tt>. This change alone, when I truly embraced it, using its
subcommand methods (see point 1 above), resulting in a ridiculous
work that involved mainly unfun work and resulted in changing (adding
and removing) thousands of lines code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The output of command <tt class="docutils literal">wajig COMMANDS</tt> is now generated
dynamically, instead of simply being read from a separate file.
Advantage is that it should now remain more up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The usage info for each COMMAND was store on its own file, and the
aliases were symblic links to them. Now that's ugly, but I did it
that was some time ago because I could not think of a better, quick
way. The ugly solution is simple, but it added over a 100 files in
user machines, which is just bad design. Well, modern Linux-based
package management makes such invisible to all but the most
avid/curious users, but I never liked it anyways. Now, all of that
help info is auto-generated by <tt class="docutils literal">argparse</tt> (you can imagine I'm a
big fan of that module by now).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There's bunch of other changes, though most was code stuff. As for
the user-visible stuff, a few COMMANDS were removed, a few options
added/removed. <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20120322T223441Z.html">Here's 'all' the gory details</a>.</p>

                    <p>Our friendly Debian developer agreed to upload yet another release of
wajig to Debian.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This one is quite special since it now uses Python 3.</li>
<li>It also does automatic dependency installation for DEB files. This
part of the work took me longer because python-apt doesn't exactly
make it easy. I even had to look in the code to be sure what exactly
is happening. I ended up using a mixture of dpkg (for installation of
stated DEBs, and to configure them) and python-apt (for the automatic
installation part).</li>
<li>The WHICHPACKAGE command, which displays which packages the given
file path belongs to, got improved. It was using custom
implementation which was broken for some uses, but there are
available tools (<tt class="docutils literal">dpkg <span class="pre">--list</span></tt> for locally-installed packages and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-file</span> search</tt> for both local and remote packages) that do the
job better, and I made use of them. These tools were probably not
avaialable the time this feature was added to wajig.</li>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Today I released <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20110427T131707Z.html">a new version of wajig</a>, first time in about half a
year. It's not even like there's some groundbreaking stuff or anything,
I just haven't put as much time. Regardless, it's quite a good release.</p>
<p>One the changes is getting rid of gjig, the GUI interface.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I actually did like it, but it was never a production standard piece
of code. It was actually quite nifty and useful, but the interface
was not at all modern or usual. It also needed a lot of polish.</li>
<li>I learned a lot from trying to port it away from the deprecated
libglade library to a more modern gtkbuilder (part of GTK+) but the
porting documentation wasn't really good, so I was left with the
option doing it from scratch. Not exactly a small task.</li>
<li>Worse still is the fact that there were more pro-looking GUI package
managers out there.</li>
<li>It didn't keep up with the pace of development wajig. It was a
2nd-class citizen.</li>
<li>Oh, and I'm so afraid of GUI developement, or should I say GTK+. It
was never an easy domain for me, and I still don't really get it. And
yes, I've tried. Maybe other toolkits are easier, and I'm too lazy to
check them out. I prefer backend stuff, where I don't have to deal
with these GUI things.</li>
<li>I wanted to move wajig forward into Python 3 land, and given that
GTK+ support for that Python version isn't exactly mature (at time of
writing), I felt that I was being held back. And don't ask me why
rush for Python 3, because you are not going to get anything stronger
than &quot;it's what the kool kids use&quot;.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Not sure, but I think this is <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/10/msg00611.html">my proudest release yet</a> of wajig so
far. Among other things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I cleaned up the Debian packaging with <a class="reference external" href="http://savetheions.com/2010/01/20/packaging-python-applicationsmodules-for-debian/">some great help</a>. I promise
that it was seriously ugly. I guess nobody was motivated enough to
clean it up... including me.</li>
<li>I added a fresh help system, and cleaned up the documentation
machinery while at it.</li>
<li>Increased the use of aptitude, where it makes sense.</li>
<li>Made some commands redundant by introducing better ones.</li>
<li>Some polishing (consistency fixes).</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Did I mention that <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/stack-overflow-rocks-hard">I love Stack Overflow</a>? It's a Q&amp;A site for
anything that is related to computer programing, and the creators
(luckily) didn't just stop there. They went on to create a bunch of
other sites using the same technology and branding, covering other
topics (and they aggregate <a class="reference external" href="http://stackexchange.com">the best new content</a> from those sites).</p>
<p>Enough with background info. What prompted this post is <a class="reference external" href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/767/what-is-the-real-difference-between-apt-get-and-aptitude-how-about-wajig/935#935">the answer</a> to
the question, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/767/what-is-the-real-difference-between-apt-get-and-aptitude-how-about-wajig">what's the difference between apt-get and
aptitude?</a>&quot;. This is from one of their sites, <em>Unix and Linux</em>, and
the answer is really thorough. Part of the question was &quot;what the heck
is wajig&quot; and I really liked how that part was handled as well. It
serves as a nice reminder of why the heck I'm working on <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/wajig/">wajig</a> in the
first place... it rocks!</p>

                    <p>I was <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/my-first-wajig-contribution">given commit access</a> to wajig project, and did a heck of a lot
of clean-ups, and in the process, learning much about unit testing.
I aimed for a comprehensive solution, partly to avoid regressions,
since I intend to do lot of code changes.</p>
<p>I also looked at converting wajig's GUI <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/gtk-migrating-GtkBuilder.html">from Glade to GtkBuilder</a>.</p>

                    <p>Due to my love for the application <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/">Quod Libet</a>, I have been
contributing a bit to it. But due the complexity of the code, I looked
elsewhere, and found a favorite tool package management tool, <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/wajig/">wajig</a>,
and was surprised to find that it's not kept in a VCS. Useful as it is,
it's code looks like a collection of hacks, so I started by offering a
PEP-8 fix.</p>
<p>[<strong>a day later</strong>] Inspired by that offer, the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/u/113620423708378221129/">nice guy</a> that founded
the project created a VCS repo for it, and even offered me <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/wajig/people/list">commit
rights</a>. I was amazed by the trust.</p>
