		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I am a big fan of the series, <em>Person of Interest</em>. There is much to
celebrate, among which is the wonderful portrayal of the brilliant
creator of the machine that (illegally) looks for patterns in society
so as to predict, with high certainty, the people will be involved in
violent crimes, either as victims or perpetrators.</p>
<p>The series' normal formula is that our heroic, bespectacled hero would
mention the details of the new person, and his very capable sidekick,
a former assassin, would go follow this person, to try avert the
impending crime. In the 16th episode of the 2nd season, however, this
formula isn't followed (by the camera). Instead we follow the person
who would be victim, and our heroes only appear midway through, like
they were secondary characters. It's beautiful.</p>
<p>I love it when such breaks from normal routine occur, especially when
they are as well-made. Not to say this is the best episode of this
series so far (I can think of a few which were superior), nor was this
the first time such a break from normal routine occur (there were some
in the earlier episodes of the season), but it felt fresh enough to be
worth a mention in this blog of mine. What added to the excitement is
that it was the first time in the series that a so-called Relevant[#]
crime prevention was showed.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I hardly ever write anything about tv productions regardless of how many
times I tend to get impressed, and there hasn't been a shortage of that.
That's mainly due to laziness/motivation, but this time I just have to
mention this one gem:</p>
<p>The very last episode of the Season mainly focuses on the trial of one
former president who is accused of treason due to surrendering to the
cylons (a species created by humans) as well as giving them official
approval to execute dozens of people. The defence given by an assistant
lawyer is a masterpiece, and would match well with any court thing I've
seen in my tv/movie-watching history. The performance matches as well,
and that's interesting because the performer/character combination is
among the least interesting in the series.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, I find this Season to be the best (in a series of
four), because it covers more interesting events (the capturing of the
humans, the resistance, their eventual rescue, and a lot more, best of
which was the trial of course).</p>
<p>This positiveness could make it look like I'm a huge fan of the series,
but I'm not. In fact, I too often tend to hate it. There's a whole lot
of religious non-sense that I can't bear, some seriously annoying
characters, at least overly eccentric one, too much day-dreaming, some
too-stupid plot decisions... but Episode 20 goes some way to help me
forgive the rest of the shit.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I got captivated by the new SABC 1 theme presentation (for lack of a
better name), which is a fusion of computer animation and live footage
with reddish filtering, an artistic impression reminding me of the
visual landmark that is 300. It's however not nearly as popular or
memorable as the previous theme which portrayed South African Black and
White people having switched roles (as in White people living in
townships and Black people leading a more affluent lifestyle). This, the
latter, is an interesting play on the stereotypical both races have on
each other and was notably also because of the superb camerawork and
some interesting acting. It's interesting as regards the former for I
thought the latter couldn't be bettered.</p>
