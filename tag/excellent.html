		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The last time I played any of the 3 games from the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(series)">God of War</a>
trilogy was nearly 2 years ago, but the experience still lives vividly
in my mind; they offered among the greatest gaming experiences I ever
had. I haven't played any of the other 4 games in the series.</p>
<p>I have known about the first game for years, before playing it, and it
was among the top of my wishlist. The appeal was simply the imagery of
the angry lead character (Kratos), the giants he was portrayed to
battle, the setting (ancient Greek mythology), as well as the title.</p>
<p>When I finally managed to get my hands on the games (about 2 years
ago), they did not disappoint. The epic feel of it all, the character
design (the best ever that covers ancient Greek mythology), and (as
regards <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_III">God of War III</a>) impressive realism, makes for a fantastic
series. Sadly, this trilogy is only available for PlayStation (2 &amp; 3).</p>
<p>My favorite characters:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Hercules (demigod, son of Zeus), who appears in the 3rd game of the
trilogy, is a mini-giant with an massive muscle structure and an
interesting attitude, not to mention armed with some awesomely
large and powerful weapons, that the playable character (Kratos)
luckily gets to play with. The moment where this Hercules character
appears is among my most favorite battle scenes in the whole
trilogy.</li>
<li>Hades (God of the Underworld), who we also only get to fight in the
3rd game of the trilogy, is another great design, and his
underworld the best environment of the whole trilogy. His
assortment of weapons is also quite impressive, but the battle
involving him, though quite good, could be more epic.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://godofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Centaur#Centaur_General">Centaur General</a> (human-horse being) were quite a presence. Not
only were they rather tough to beat, but they were also the most
charming characters in the whole trilogy. One wishes they had a
greater screen time. Note that there were other Centaurs in the
trilogy, but these particular ones were most interesting, and their
slaying most... beautiful. They appear first time in the 3rd game
in the trilogy.</li>
<li>Poseidon (God of the Sea), is an interesting one. His represents
the most complex (and hardest) fight sequence in the entire
trilogy, it it also happens on the third installment of this fine
trilogy. It's not exactly my favorite, but his character has a
certain level of charm, and the final kill is particularly brutal.</li>
<li>Kratos, the protagonist, was most impressive in the first game, but
he was getting less interesting later on and the novelty of his
anger was wearing off. He was also getting petty at times, and too
bloodthirsty to be convincing. Regardless, he is a work of superb
character design, and this well-enhanced by the pale color and red
stripes on his skin, as well as a body that makes him look like pure
lethal.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://godofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Talos">Stone Talos</a> are a one-of-a-kind character... muscular stone
statues that come to life to incur damage on our protagonist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Awesome as it is, the series does have weaknesses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There is one notable bad work of character design, which is
Ares, the original god of war (a title Kratos took from him after
defeating him). He is totally uninresting (and clumsy), and the battle
in which the two fight is the worst in the trilogy.</li>
<li>One other horrible character was the goat-snake-lion combo
character. It was probably a first in gaming history, but it was a
real stupid idea.</li>
<li>There were also some particilarly hard stages to pass, where I had
to ask for help from a friend to proceed to the next level. I hate
stuff like that... I normally pick the easiest difficulty level in
games, for I hate to struggle for too long.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A very laid-back Burning Spear album, with a mere 9 short tracks, the
best of which is a re-imagining of one of my eternal favorite tracks of
all time, <em>Creation</em> (live versions). It's named <em>It's A Long Way
Around</em>, and I could not stop myself from repeating it.</p>
<p>Each of the other tracks is quite good, though not catchy at all.</p>

		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I recently got hold of &quot;Hold It Down&quot; (1995) by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_EFX">Das EFX</a>. Real good
ole-style hip-hop, thanks to a friend who, when I asked who he reckoned
the best hip-hop group is, he mentioned Das EFX. In my investigations, I
also got hold of their &quot;Generation EFX&quot; (1998) which is really bad.
Strange that just 3 years later people can fuck up like that.</p>
<p>Here's my favorites:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>track 18 â€“ <em>Hardcore Rap Act</em></li>
<li>track 12 â€“ <em>Alright</em></li>
<li>track 05 â€“ <em>Real Hip Hop</em></li>
</ol>
