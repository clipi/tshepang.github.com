                    <p>Someone asked me to try get some KDE package into Debian. I estimated
that it would take me around 10 hours to get it into good enough shape
before asking some Debian Developer to upload it for me. Here goes
some rough estimates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>hour 1</strong>: Find documentation on the subject; I got three after a
quick search:<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html">Ubuntu Packaging Guide</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuideDeprecated/QtApplication">Create Ubuntu DEB package from a Qt application</a> (marked as
deprecated, probably in favor of the official guide above)</li>
<li>Debian Packaging Tutorial (from Debian package,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">packaging-tutorial</span></tt>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>hour 2-3</strong>: Reading the Debian Packaging Tutorial which led me to
reading <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dpkg-source</span></tt> manpage, using <tt class="docutils literal">dh_make</tt> to create a
<tt class="docutils literal">debian/</tt> skeleton, and modifying the contents of that directory.</li>
<li><strong>hour 4-6</strong>: Struggling to kill the lintian complaint,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">binary-without-manpage</span></tt>. I went as far as reading the source code
(Perl) that performs the check, but that didn't help much. I could
have saved hours by looking at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide">Debian New Maintainers' Guide</a>
earlier. I also added <tt class="docutils literal">export <span class="pre">LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,relro</span></tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal">debian/rules</tt> file to kill <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hardening-no-relro</span></tt> lintian
warning.</li>
<li><strong>hour 7-8</strong>: Determine what dependencies would be needed by building from
a clean chroot (pbuilder). This was with the help of Debian New
Maintainers' Guide, again.</li>
<li><strong>hour 9-10</strong>: Reading <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening">Debian wiki page on Hardening</a> let me
simplify my packaging further... removing the need to specify
hardening flags explicitly (<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/ksig/commits/f4c7b60157b79847f918e3d8b24a74e6c5bec929">commit</a>). I also uploaded the package
<a class="reference external" href="http://mentors.debian.net/package/ksig">to mentors.debian.net</a>, with the help of <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsFaq">DebianMentorsFaq</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting package now lives at
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/ksig/src">https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/ksig/src</a>. The changes I made, the
actual packaging work, are in <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/ksig/src/f4c7b60157b79847f918e3d8b24a74e6c5bec929/debian">this directory</a>.</p>

                    <p>I've recently looked at Ubuntu's 10.04 and 10.10 installers, and they
are quite nifty tools, so fresh and gorgeous, and so easy to use that
nobody would dare say &quot;I can't install Linux!&quot;. And then I recently
re-installed my Debian system and I don't really see how much harder it
is to use than Ubuntu's (except that it's far uglier, so I guess that
also makes it intimidating).</p>
<p>What triggered this post is the following titbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d-i [Debian Installer] is the very first thing many of our users
see, and has a huge range of uses, from simple desktop installs to
massive corporate deployments; it's unspeakably important that it
works well, and it's a testament to its design that it's been able
to trundle along without actually very much serious refactoring for
the best part of five years now.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;<a class="reference external" href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/11/25/people-behind-debian-colin-watson/">an interview of Colin Watson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, this tool (or rather, a set of tools) also happens to be
rock-solid tool, and its great reliability gets admiration from me on
each install (and I've done dozens, with not one instance of data loss).</p>

                    <p>I think anyone who has never done any OS install before can install
Debian with any issue at all, provided they will not be doing any
partitioning. It is that easy.</p>
<p>As for me, I do a lot more installations than the average person, so I
semi-automate the setup process with the help of this script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">tshepang</tt> codename refers to my custom repository, the one
managed by <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/project-of-note-reprepro">reprepro</a>.</p>
<p>Contents of <strong>sudo</strong> setup file:</p>

<p>The one change from default <strong>sudo</strong> setup is so that each bash session
can inherit sudo powers from another. It's one case where I trade
<a class="reference external" href="http://ask.debian.net/questions/how-to-have-sudo-powers-shared-between-different-bash-sessions">security</a> for convenience. Another such case is increasing the
ask-for-password timeout to 100 minutes, instead of the default 15
minutes.</p>
<p>And then these aliases, which point to scripts that install some
packages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ibase</tt>: basic stuff I got to have, stuff like the components I use
for my desktop apps, some CLI tools, and some documentation</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">inondebian</tt>: packages that aren't part of Debian, e.g. stuff from
external repositories, or nonm-free stuff from Debian repos</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">itracker</tt>: I always run the git version of <a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/">Tracker</a>, so these
tools help me build it</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ipurge</tt>: stuff that was installed as Recommends dependencies of
the above (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnome-bluetooth</span></tt>) or during Debian installation
(e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">vim</tt>), but that I won't use</li>
</ul>
<p>The symbolic links is so that those I share a network with (LAN) can
have easy web browser access to some stuff on my machine.</p>

wajig, but soon after, I noticed that an exception occurs if you run a

available for the configured foreign architecture, but not for the
native one (<a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=679969">bug 679969</a>). To fix that, I released 2.7.1, but I
submitted a dirty tarball for upload, so had to resubmit, ending up
releasing 2.7.2. Later on, someone noticed that <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=681309">a certain subcommand
wasn't recognized</a>, and I released 2.7.3 which fixes the issue.</p>

                    <p>Version 2.6 of wajig has changes so small that I did not bother writing
about its release, but was nevertheless very important because the
bash-completion now works a lot better than before,
thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/">Reuben Thomas</a>.
I also stopped wajig from accepting UPPERCASE subcommands,
since a few people on the mailing list expressed dislike,
and that includes project founder.</p>
<p>Version 2.7, the version that will be in the next stable release of
Debian [<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/debian-7-will-release-with-wajig-273">update</a>], Wheezy (Debian 7), fixes two bugs, one of which I
sort of intentionally broke in order to fix some issues with the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--simulate</span></tt> and/or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--teaching</span></tt> options.
Someone <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.debian.org/670687">did complain about this</a> which was good since it's a good
indicator that someone actually cared about the feature.
That motivated me to fix it,
and I ensured that the fix was in before Debian 7 freeze.</p>
<p>This work is my greatest contribution for this upcoming Debian
release.</p>

                    <p>I suspect that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> isn't a trivial piece of software, and I
consider it among the greatest of all FLOSS. It even bills itself the
most advanced of all FLOSS databases. That's what brought <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piware.de/">Martin Pitt</a>
to my attention, for he is it's Debian (and now also Ubuntu) maintainer.
One other notable thing about him is his quiet persona (I follow Debian
development fairly closely, and I don't remember seeing him take part in
any of the arguments in its mailing lists). I only ever notice him when
he'd give <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piware.de/2011/09/dropping-postgresql-9-0-packages-for-debianubuntubackports/">some random</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piware.de/2012/05/packages-for-postgresql-9-2-beta-1-now-available/">status update</a>.</p>

posts are actually outdated, I still keep a custom repository, a subset
of the official repository of a specific arch, but only of packages that
I ever install.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Every once in a while, I run this command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro -vv --basedir ~/.custom_repo/ includedeb tshepang \
/var/cache/apt/archives/*deb
</pre>
<p>What it does is add packages that are stored by the Debian package
management system (located in <tt class="docutils literal">/var/cache/apt/archives</tt>) to the
custom repository (located in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.custom_repo</span></tt>). That ensures that I
only keep packages that matter to me for any later install.</p>
<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal">tshepang</tt> is the name of the repository. It's an unofficial
equivalent of <tt class="docutils literal">testing</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">unstable</tt>.</p>
<p>Another command that I sometimes run, though less frequently, is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro -vv --basedir ~/.custom_repo/ includedeb tshepang \
/var/cache/apt/archives/*deb
</pre>
<p>This one is used to help keep the repository fresh. Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/removing-obsolete-packages-from-a-local-debian-repository">this
post</a> for an explanation.</p>
<p>Even less frequently, it happens that some package files are no longer
referenced (i.e. not found in <tt class="docutils literal">Package.gz</tt>) for some reason. Here's
handy command to display them:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro --basedir ~/.custom_repo dumpunreferenced
</pre>
<p>And here's another that actually gets rid of them:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro --basedir ~/.custom_repo deleteunreferenced
</pre>

<ul class="simple">
<li>his great passion for Debian (he speaks on behalf of it on a variety

<li>mature and thoughtfulness in a variety of debates regarding this or
that decision within Debian</li>
<li>his ongoing push for collaboration between Debian and other distros</li>
<li>his positive outlook for Debian, at a time when many are worried
about its loss of relevance</li>
<li>his passion for software freedom (we need people like this in an age
where people tend to trade freedom for pragmatism)</li>
</ul>
<p>To prove I'm not the only one, there a bunch more guys who were happy
enough with his 2010 term as Debian Project Leader (DPL), that they
re-elected him again. What's more interesting is that no one else stood
for election. He also won the term <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/2012/msg00008.html">the third time</a>, so will reign over
Debian in 2012.</p>

                    <p>Less than a week after releasing 2.3, someone discovered a bug when
running the NEW subcommand. All wajig did was fall flat with an ugly
exception, making this some sort of emergency release. Anyways, I
already had some nice improvements, so I released those as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The INSTALL subcommand can now be given a mixture of filenames, .deb
files, and normal package names, and will be able to install the
packages specified. Previously, only one of these 3 types could be
installed at a time.</li>
<li>Apparently the reasons I gave for removing the —simulate and
—teaching (now renamed to —teach) options in 2.3 weren't good enough,
so I reinstated them.</li>
<li>The bash completer now completes both lower-case and upper-case
subcommands, thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/">Reuben Thomas</a>, an avid wajig user.</li>
<li>There's a few other changes, so <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20120327T130420Z.html">here's the gory details</a>.</li>

                    </h2>

                    <p>It's been many months since wajig was released, but this was about as
good as any since I probably did far more work on it than on any other
release so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The most user-visible change is that I changed the UI to feel more
standard/natural, where each of the wajig COMMANDS are 1st-class
citizens. Let me give an example of user wanting to install a package
named nautilus, but avoid installing its Recommends depencencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># ole</span>
wajig —norecommends INSTALL nautilus
<span class="c"># new</span>
wajig INSTALL —norecommends nautilus
</pre></div>
<p>I call this natural because it makes more sense to have the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--norecommends</span></tt> command line option to be specified <em>after</em> the
(wajig) subcommand it modifies. Also, the way it was implemented
previously, the option would silently be ignored if it was used in a
case where it was irrelevant. That's not good, and it links to the
next user-visible change.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There is less magic and more strictness. Previously, these commands
resulted in the same outcome:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wajig REMOVEORPHANS
wajig REMOVE-ORPHANS
wajig R-____EMOVE-ORPH----___AN_S
</pre>
<p>What wajig did was simply sanitise the commands, getting rid of the
junk. Well, I don't like that, but since I didn't want to break
people's commands/aliases/scripts I actually tried to preserve that
functionality, but argparse didn't let me do that, and messing around
with <tt class="docutils literal">sys.argv</tt> before argparse jumped in was an error-prone mess,
which links us to the next change, this time behind-the-scenes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I replaced the archaic <tt class="docutils literal">getopt</tt> CLI parser with a far more powerful
<tt class="docutils literal">argparse</tt>. This change alone, when I truly embraced it, using its
subcommand methods (see point 1 above), resulting in a ridiculous
work that involved mainly unfun work and resulted in changing (adding
and removing) thousands of lines code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The output of command <tt class="docutils literal">wajig COMMANDS</tt> is now generated
dynamically, instead of simply being read from a separate file.
Advantage is that it should now remain more up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The usage info for each COMMAND was store on its own file, and the
aliases were symblic links to them. Now that's ugly, but I did it
that was some time ago because I could not think of a better, quick
way. The ugly solution is simple, but it added over a 100 files in
user machines, which is just bad design. Well, modern Linux-based
package management makes such invisible to all but the most
avid/curious users, but I never liked it anyways. Now, all of that
help info is auto-generated by <tt class="docutils literal">argparse</tt> (you can imagine I'm a
big fan of that module by now).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There's bunch of other changes, though most was code stuff. As for
the user-visible stuff, a few COMMANDS were removed, a few options
added/removed. <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20120322T223441Z.html">Here's 'all' the gory details</a>.</p>

<h2>background info</h2>
<p>Bandwidth in South Africa is neither readily-available nor cheap, so
whenever I fetch and install Debian packages (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> upgrade</tt>),
I also keep them in a local custom repository. I use a great tool named
<a class="reference external" href="http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/">reprepro</a> for this, and this is the command I use to update that
repository, given the location of the fresh package files:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro -vv --basedir ~/.custom_repo/ includedeb tshepang /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb
</pre>
<p>What's nice about the command is that, if there is an older version of
the pacakge I'm adding, it gets replaced, and the package index is
update accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-now-to-the-topic-at-hand">
<h2>and now to the topic at hand</h2>
<p>I run that command more or less regularly, but very often the repository
accumulates some junk:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a package gets renamed, reprepro has no way of knowing (at least
as far as my setup goes). One notable case of this is Debian kernels,
whose names match the major release versions (e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linux-image-3.1.0-1-686-pae</span></tt> becomes
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linux-image-3.2.0-1-686-pae</span></tt> when a new upstream release gets
packaged). Lots other packages change names, and very often, for a
variety of reasons (Debian is a little chaotic, often out of
necessity, and it's amazing that its developers keep it so damn
stable given all this change).</li>
<li>If I add a package from an external repository or that I converted
from an rpm, reprepro has no way of knowing that fact. Now if I stop
using that package, it is just a waste of resources (CPU and disk
usage).</li>
</ul>

                    </h2>

                    <p>In <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my previous job</a>, we used to use some Java framework, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mulesoft.org/">Mule ESB</a>,
for our clients. The project is distributed with a lot of jar files,
supposedly for the convenience of users. When we work on a project, we
just add all those jars to the classpath (we use Eclipse, an excessively
powerful and ugly IDE). Now, me being a sucker for the Debian way of
doing things, I'd install packages providing all those jars from a
Debian repository, then remove those Mule-distributed files, then add
symlinks in place of them pointing back to the actualy files. Imagine
how much time it took! Either that, or even easier (but still
time-consuming), skip the symlink thing entirely and just add those jars
(found in <strong>/usr/share/java</strong> directory) directly.</p>
<p>Beyond just wasting time, the are other potential problems with my
approach:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Debian's jar versions did tend to be different to Mule-supplied
versions. You can imagine what problems this can cause, especially
because the versions included there are most likely the ones used for
testing Mule.</li>
<li>Even if the versions were the same, what if there are slight changes
from Debian's side. Debian's strict <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">software guidelines</a> implies
that they'll strip out some stuff that doesn't adhere. The good thing
is that Debian appends <tt class="docutils literal">dfsg</tt> to the version number, but <a class="reference external" href="http://askubuntu.com/q/11592/2591">not
everybody knows that</a>. And even if they did, they would then need to
spend time checking exactly what changed.</li>
<li>Debian doesn't merely re-distribute the jar files. They actually
rebuild them, with Debian-supplied compilers. Maybe this isn't an
issue for Java projects, but who knows.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to knock the Debian way of doing things. It's actually quite
excellent (hence my love), but it can't fit all scenarios. See Matt
Zimmerman's <a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/07/06/weve-packaged-all-of-the-free-software-what-now/">excellent post</a>, where he touches on this issue.</p>
<p>I did wise up a bit by simply doing things the way the makers of Mule
intended.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I have been using an Acer TravelMate 6592 laptop for close to 3 years
(ever since I got <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my coding job</a>). It had some issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.co.za/search?hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=630&amp;q=6592+acer&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">it's damn ugly</a>, though not as much as Lenovo ones</li>
<li>it requires Intel non-free firmware for its Wi-Fi chipset</li>
<li>it frequently refused to make the LAN accessible from Linux on boot;
this was likely a BIOS issue</li>
<li>the battery capacity was below 50% so it didn't last</li>
<li>the hard drive was developing bad sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, it truly was an excellent laptop, and I never
complained about its performance, ever since I added a 2GB RAM stick, to
make it a total of 4GB (except that I wished my HDD was faster, tempting
me to buy an SSD). What else I really liked about it is the
feature-packed touchpad: Beyond the normal two-finger and
side-scrolling, it also had up-down-left-right buttons which allowed
constant-speed scrolling. It's interesting that such a touchpad is very
rare.</p>
<p>I now got an HP Probook 4530s and its pros:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=probook+4530s&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=630">it's stunning</a></li>
<li>it's got a real fast hard drive; there were times when I saw speeds
upwards to 70MB/s, which I never saw with the older laptop</li>
<li>its Wi-Fi doesn't require non-free software</li>
<li>it's far more modern (USB3 support) and supposedly faster (Core
i5-2410M vs. Core 2 Duo T7500), but my typical workload made even the
TravelMate more than adequate</li>
</ul>
<p>And the cons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a less featureful touchpad</li>
<li>keyboard keys placed in weird locations (e.g. <strong>pg up</strong> and <strong>pg dn</strong>
buttons are placed far away, at the top-right corner; I blame the
(needless for me) numeric keypad</li>
<li>the screen resolution is on the low side and so is the screen size;
the older laptop is much bigger even if they are both labeled 15.4&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>...and Debian:</p>
<p>Quite a few times, I tend to want to stick to a stable release of
Debian. Following Debian development does take time (frequent updates,
curiosity to see what changed, and something getting broken here and
there). So I tried to do the same here. Sadly, some of the software in
Squeeze is too outdated to be optimal, so am glad to have teams like
<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/thanks-to-the-debian-backports-team">Debian Backports folk</a>. But that wasn't enough, so I ended up
installing Xorg components from Debian Unstable (Suspend doesn't work
well with Squeeze (Debian 6) and backports doesn't have a newer X
version.</p>
<p>Let's see how long I last trying to keep pure by running as little from
outside Squeeze as possible.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>:</p>
<p>This didn't even last for 1 day. I was having issues with my X hanging
the entire OS, forcing me to do a hard-reboot. This happened when I was
watching a video using VLC, so I blamed it and installed the version
from Debian Unstable. Sadly, doing things that way resulted in a VLC
that refused to die normally, forcing me to do <tt class="docutils literal">kill <span class="pre">-9</span> vlc</tt>. I then
just screwed my plans and upgraded fully to Unstable, and now VLC quits
gracefully. Let's see if I'll have the X lockup again.</p>
<p><strong>update 2</strong>:</p>
<p>Well, I still experience machine lock-ups, the bad ones forcing a
hard-reboot. This might be related to Wi-Fi because I used the system
for quite a while using the wired link, without any such lock-up.</p>
<p><strong>update 3</strong>:</p>
<p>No more lock-ups, except very rarely. I run a mix of Testing and
Unstable at the moment, but my &quot;/etc/sources.list&quot; file points solely at
my custom repository and Testing, for it just is tiring to keep tracking
Unstable... way too much bandwidth.</p>

                    <p>So I got this new HP laptop, Probook 4530s, and installed Debian 6
(Squeeze) on it. I was left sitting with two unbearable problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The touchpad wasn't fully operational (GNOME Mouse Preferences didn't
have a Touchpad tab where I could change the settings).</li>
<li>The video driver seemed to have a problem according to the output of
<strong>xvinfo</strong> (<tt class="docutils literal">no adaptors present</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I curiously looked at <a class="reference external" href="http://backports.debian.org/">the backports</a>, and found Linux kernel 2.6.38
(Squeeze has 2.6.32). I didn't expect much from it, but installed it
anyway (I heard that it has improved desktop responsiveness). I was
pleasantly surprised to find that it fixed the above two problems.
Loveliness.</p>
<p>On another note, I found that Mercurial 1.8 also has a backport.
This is great news because I have repositories I created with that
version and the format is incompatible with Squeeze's 1.6.</p>

                    <p>Our friendly Debian developer agreed to upload yet another release of
wajig to Debian.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This one is quite special since it now uses Python 3.</li>
<li>It also does automatic dependency installation for DEB files. This
part of the work took me longer because python-apt doesn't exactly
make it easy. I even had to look in the code to be sure what exactly
is happening. I ended up using a mixture of dpkg (for installation of
stated DEBs, and to configure them) and python-apt (for the automatic
installation part).</li>
<li>The WHICHPACKAGE command, which displays which packages the given
file path belongs to, got improved. It was using custom
implementation which was broken for some uses, but there are
available tools (<tt class="docutils literal">dpkg <span class="pre">--list</span></tt> for locally-installed packages and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-file</span> search</tt> for both local and remote packages) that do the
job better, and I made use of them. These tools were probably not
avaialable the time this feature was added to wajig.</li>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Today I released <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20110427T131707Z.html">a new version of wajig</a>, first time in about half a
year. It's not even like there's some groundbreaking stuff or anything,
I just haven't put as much time. Regardless, it's quite a good release.</p>
<p>One the changes is getting rid of gjig, the GUI interface.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I actually did like it, but it was never a production standard piece
of code. It was actually quite nifty and useful, but the interface
was not at all modern or usual. It also needed a lot of polish.</li>
<li>I learned a lot from trying to port it away from the deprecated
libglade library to a more modern gtkbuilder (part of GTK+) but the
porting documentation wasn't really good, so I was left with the
option doing it from scratch. Not exactly a small task.</li>
<li>Worse still is the fact that there were more pro-looking GUI package
managers out there.</li>
<li>It didn't keep up with the pace of development wajig. It was a
2nd-class citizen.</li>
<li>Oh, and I'm so afraid of GUI developement, or should I say GTK+. It
was never an easy domain for me, and I still don't really get it. And
yes, I've tried. Maybe other toolkits are easier, and I'm too lazy to
check them out. I prefer backend stuff, where I don't have to deal
with these GUI things.</li>
<li>I wanted to move wajig forward into Python 3 land, and given that
GTK+ support for that Python version isn't exactly mature (at time of
writing), I felt that I was being held back. And don't ask me why
rush for Python 3, because you are not going to get anything stronger
than &quot;it's what the kool kids use&quot;.</li>

                    <p>With all the noise regarding GNOME 3, I decided to lose patience and go
check it out. Thing is it's currently in Debian Experimental suite, so I
installed the essential components from there, stuff like gnome-shell,
mutter and gnome-panel, and things weren't so smooth. So I thought that
it might be because I was still using Squeeze (Debian 6, released in
February), so I upgraded my entire system to Sid (the main Debian
development suite). Well, the new hotness wasn't as usable as I'd like,
so I decided to go back to my rock-solid and familiar GNOME 2
environment. I was surpride that I could to downgrade the whole thing
back to Squeeze, without any major hitch. Of course the downgrading
process wasn't exactly smooth (lots of package removals before
re-installation for one), but I'm running Squeeze as we speak.</p>
<p>It would have been quicker for me to just re-install of course,
especially because I have some installation and setup scripts to make it
quick. But doing that would imply I wouln't have access to my computer
for minutes on end. Not good. Also, it's nice that I continued running
that fine-looking GNOME 3, while under-the-hood it was being removed. It
took just a logout and back in to be back home... GNOME 2 from Squeeze.
Note that this sort of thing is not officially supported by Debian. It's
probably going to be harder to do this as Unstable develops further. But
this exercise gave me newfound respect for the strength and stability of
the Debian system.</p>

                    <p>The efforts that Josselin Mouette puts into maintaining Debian's GNOME
are amazing (and seemingly thankless). He is the most visible member of
that team-maintained part of Debian. He also portrays deep knowledge of
GNOME's oft-inconsistent and oft-complex internals, and does participate
in upstream discussions.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of his heroic efforts:</p>

<p>The line <tt class="docutils literal">import apt_pkg</tt> implies that <strong>python3-apt</strong> is installed.</p>

0.9.22-1    0.9.21-3    (pulseaudio-utils)
</pre>
<p>Here, we get a display of package versions where the repo1 (custom repo
in this case) is greater than repo2 version. To do it the other way
around, use the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;</tt> character in the comparison line, <tt class="docutils literal">if vc &gt; 0</tt>.</p>

look elsewhere for <a class="reference external" href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/05/installing-and-using-cxoracle-on-unix.html">something more generic</a>.</p>
<p><strong>downloads</strong>:</p>

Zimmerman's blog. This a Debian Developer who also happens to do paid
work on Ubuntu as well (employed by Canonical). He writes clearly and
with a sober and mature tone. It's very interesting when you see a
software developer conversant with non-technical stuff, and able to
write about it so well.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I started with one post with an obviously interesting title, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/06/12/how-to-decide-what-to-read-and-what-not-to-read/">How to
decide what to read (and what not to read)?</a>&quot;. This piqued my
interest also because I've been thinking about <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/where-i-live-on-the-web">my own activities on
the web</a> too. Also, his mention of News closely match mine, other
than that I'm simply (mostly) not interested in traditional big news
(presidents approves blah) and tabloids, and normally get enough of a
dose from co-workers and friends, and mostly face-to-face.</li>
<li>This led to another, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/04/06/breadth-and-depth/">Breadth and depth</a>&quot;, in which he touches on
the social effects of web-enabled technology. This is a topic that
has been beaten to death of course, but he fortunately keeps his
contribution very brief and fresh, and I like that he doesn't claim
to offer any solutions, but merely exploring them.</li>
<li>And there was &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2009/05/03/internet-discussion-trends/">Internet discussion trends: from Usenet to
micro-blogs</a>&quot;, where he discussed various ways forms of on-line
discussion, which is the first topic of its type I've seen yet.</li>
<li>He even dabbled with a bit of poetry in &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/12/02/breathing-information/">Breathing information</a>&quot;.
Nice attempt.</li>
<li>He also displays an insightful understanding of what package
management in &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/07/06/weve-packaged-all-of-the-free-software-what-now/">We've packaged all of the free software...what

</ul>
<p>There's a whole bunch of gorgeous-sounding posts that I didn't care to
read yet, and hope to keep the above list updated when I do.</p>

                    <p>Not sure, but I think this is <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/10/msg00611.html">my proudest release yet</a> of wajig so
far. Among other things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I cleaned up the Debian packaging with <a class="reference external" href="http://savetheions.com/2010/01/20/packaging-python-applicationsmodules-for-debian/">some great help</a>. I promise
that it was seriously ugly. I guess nobody was motivated enough to
clean it up... including me.</li>
<li>I added a fresh help system, and cleaned up the documentation
machinery while at it.</li>
<li>Increased the use of aptitude, where it makes sense.</li>
<li>Made some commands redundant by introducing better ones.</li>
<li>Some polishing (consistency fixes).</li>
</ul>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Much of this is obsolete: I no longer use <tt class="docutils literal">debmirror</tt> and no longer
keep the entire binary repository of i386 arch.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There's a useful tool in Debian named debmirror. It's function is to
create and manage a partial copy of an official Debian repository, and I
use it to create 2 repos:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an entire i386 Debian repo for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/">Squeeze</a></li>
<li>an entire source Debian repo for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/">Squeeze</a></li>
</ul>
<p>How this works is that I'd run the following command
(an example for the source repo):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/usr/bin/debmirror
 --verbose
 --progress
 --host=ftp.sun.ac.za
 --passive
 --dist=squeeze
 --root=ftp/debian
 --section=main
 --method=ftp
 --arch=none
 /home/wena/.repo_src
</pre>
<p>(look at debmirror's manpage to see what all those options mean)</p>
<p>The result is that I'll be having ~30GB of Debian locally (for a
comparison, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/mirror/size">total Debian archive size</a>).</p>
<p>That's a lot of data, most of which I'll never use, but:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I do this as a matter of convenience; I want to be able to install
anything when I'm having a fresh machine, and internet access is not
yet fast and cheap in South Africa.</li>
<li>I also like to mess around with the packaging system, deleting and
reinstalling packages on a whim, and I don't want to be waiting for
some file to download when I do that kind of tinkering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, since it's ridiculous to do this every time just to have the most
recent packages (a weekly update is maybe &gt;1GB of data), I've found
another wonderful tool named reprepro. It's purpose is to create a
custom (unofficial) Debian repo. It's a far more advanced tool than
debmirror, and I think it can do what debmirror does (but I don't yet
care to learn how).</p>
<p>Moving on, here's the relevant entries from my /etc/apt/sources.list file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># local repos (debmirror)</span>
deb file:/home/wena/.repo_bin sid main
deb-src file:/home/wena/.repo_src sid main

<span class="c"># local repo (reprepro)</span>
deb file:/home/wena/.repo_local cache main

<span class="c"># remote repo</span>
deb ftp://ftp.sun.ac.za/ftp/debian/ sid main non-free contrib
</pre></div>
<p>So, what I do on a semi-regular basis is run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ wajig update &amp;&amp; wajig upgrade
</pre>
<p>The newly-updated packages are stored in a cache so that a reinstall
doesn't have to fetch from network again. After this I run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro -vv --basedir ~/.repo_local includedeb cache /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb
</pre>
<p>This updates the local reprepro repo and after which I can then remove
the cached packages:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ wajig clean
</pre>
<p>I do that because they are now available in my reprepro-managed repo.
That now means that I got a massive mirror managed by debmirror and a
smaller one managed by reprepro, and I have these on an external drive
for in case I want to install Debian anywhere. What else my reprepro
repo has is some other packages like <strong>skype</strong> and <strong>oracle-xe</strong>, as
well as an odd packages from <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental">Debian Experimental</a>.</p>
<p>Not so simple I guess... but works so well for my needs.</p>

                    <p>Much of this is obsolete: I no longer build my own Debian packages.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>That's a joke title, but <a class="reference external" href="http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/">that fabulous tool</a> really did help me a
lot. When doing package builds, all I need to run is the following
after a build:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>rm *udeb
<span class="nv">$ </span>reprepro --basedir ~/.repo_directory includedeb sid *deb
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get update
</pre></div>
<p>The first command removes debian-installer packages which I don't need,
the second takes the remaining packages and adds them into the
reprepro-managed Debian repository while also making them available in
the Packages file, and the third updates the system's apt database in
order to pick up the changes. Also, if I want to get rid of something
from the repo, all I do is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ reprepro --basedir ~/.repo_directory removesrc sid glibc
</pre>
<p>I don't know why anyone would love to remove glibc binary packages, but
it's that simple.</p>
<p>Achieving this used to be painful before I discovered reprepro, for I
did the whole thing manually, which was not scalable since old packages
were sitting rotting in the repo, making it grow beyond 30GB (it now is
about 10GB). This also meant that I ran 'apt-ftparchive packages' on the
entire .debs each time I wanted an updated Packages file, and that was
dozens of minutes of heavy I/O. This painful life has been going on for
a number of months, and am stupid that I didn't search harder for a
better solution.</p>
<p>Before doing things this way, I was making use of the nifty <a class="reference external" href="http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/">APTonCD</a>,
but it started to become unusable due to excessive memory consumption
after some system updates. It's not clear where the bug lies, nor do I
know if it's a known problem, which I didn't report because I was using
Ubuntu's package, a much improved and re-written 0.1.98, as opposed to
Debian's 'bug-free' 0.1 (though I later discovered the bug to exist when
running the package in Ubuntu 8.10 too).</p>

it could very well become their GNU/Linux killer app. I came across it

                    <p>Steve Langasek has been Debian release manager for over two years and
always managed to impress me with his technical knowledge of Debian
packaging as well as relentless effort into getting this, the Debian
system, into a releasable operating system. He is the definitive Debian
watchdog, for I often pay attention when it's his turn to talk on
mailing lists, and he also happens to be among the most powerful of all
DD's (for it's said that Debian release managers tend to be more
powerful than Debian project leaders). Grandmaster!</p>

a point was raised that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Murdock">Ian Murdock</a>, Debian founder,
successfully transferred project leadership to someone else, a fact that

                    <p>In celebration of the beginning of this exercise, I recognize Aurelien
Jarno as a very notable developer. This is due to his tireless efforts
as the number one GLibC co-maintainer in Debian since several months (if
the package's debian changelog is to be relied upon). Also, GLibC,
together with GCC and Linux, ought to be regarded as the most important
packages of any GNU/Linux system.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>In order to minimize bandwidth usage, I have recently restricted myself
to building a local repository consisting only of source packages as
opposed to the previous times when I only did binary package downloads.
This was helped by my recently-acquired skill of building Debian
packages from source, most often just 3 simple commands:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">build-dep</span> nautilus</tt> (retrieves nautilus' build
dependencies)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo <span class="pre">apt-get</span> source <span class="pre">--build</span> nautilus</tt> (downloads nautilus' source
into current directory and builds a Debian binary package out of it)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo dpkg <span class="pre">--install</span> *deb</tt> (installs the .deb files stated on the
command line onto the system)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've been practicing the above procedure on several packages, including
monsters like Linux, GLibC and OpenOffice.org, and it worked pretty
well.</p>
<p>I did the same for GNOME 2.16/2.18 packages (Debian GNOME maintainers
haven't completed the job of migrating to 2.18 yet) available in
Debian's <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.debian.org/experimental/">Experimental repository</a>. This effort was initially targetted
at building 2.16 version of python-gnome and 2.10 version of python-gtk2
in order to try to build Scribes, after a previous failure. But then,
since I had much GNOME infrastructure (libgtk2, libbonono, libgnomevfs2,
...) already built, I proceeded on building some of my favorites as well
(nautilus, gnome-terminal, gedit, etc.), and, even though I only had ~3
hours of sleep, I woke up a happy being.</p>
<p>I almost forgot to mention that Scribes managed to run properly, though
I didn't have enough time to check it out properly. It sure looks good
and am looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>[a day later]</strong></p>
<p>Although I managed to get <a class="reference external" href="http://scribes.sourceforge.net/index.html">Scribes</a> to hang at least once, here's the
more positive facts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I really do love the auto-save feature</li>
<li>the interface is real clean, providing a fresh departure from the
stately (and beloved) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/">gedit</a></li>
<li>it's got word-suggestion by default</li>
<li>there's some other nifty nice features like various editing
capabilities which are far more powerful than gedit provides</li>
</ul>

I've been ignoring this technology because I was too lazy to figure it out,
