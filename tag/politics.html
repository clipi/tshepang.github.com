                    </h2>

                    <p>There have been many great benefits I got from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org">the Debian project</a>,
but among the most important is my introduction to Anarchism, a radical
political theory that opposes all forms of official hierarchy
(capitalism, communism, religion, etc), arguing that such things tend to
result in oppression.</p>
<p>How I got access to that is via a package known as <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/anarchism">anarchism</a>, a set
of documents formally known as <a class="reference external" href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html">An Anarchist FAQ</a>. It's a very
comprehensive coverage of the theory, and going through it brought both
enlightenment and frustration, for it explained so many things that I
took for granted, while pointing out the causes. The theory is basically
presented as the best possible society humans could ever have.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm not sure if it's actually true, although I lean more
towards it than alternatives (and I haven't read anything extensive on
competing theories, but intuition/experience tells me that capitalism,
communism, and religion all suck tremendously). I need more study to be
more sure, especially because the objections to Anarchism are heavy.</p>
<p>To me it's a scarier concept to introduce yourself as an anarchist than
as an atheist or a homosexual, because the implications are greater. In
fact, they are so great, that the word <em>anarchy</em> itself has been
associated with chaos. That's an expected knee-jerk reaction you'll get
when you punt things like &quot;I reject all forms of official authority,
including all governments!&quot;. But it would be nice if people who shudder
at the concept to spend time with <a class="reference external" href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html">that great document</a>.</p>
<p>My attraction to the theory perhaps is due to my radically liberal
tendencies (EG, I don't see anything wrong with fucking my biological
mother, provided it's consensual, and there's no pregnancy). I don't
know where these tendencies originate, considering that I was a
religious nut back in my early teens, scared of the concept of hell and
similar forms of bullshit.</p>

                    <p>I was innocently doing some FLOSS reading when I bumped on a real
gorgeous description on why anarchy is the <a class="reference external" href="http://loupgaroublond.blogspot.com/2008/12/open-source-and-anarchism.html?showComment=1229842200000#c4468517513122259751">best possible society ever

                    </h2>

                    <p>I was reading some old Debian posts where there was an argument brewing
regarding the existence of anarchy within Debian. A notable point raised
was that the existence of the GPL, the leading FLOSS licence, was
impossible because a licence's existence requires laws to exist. The
argument was that, since anarchy is against law (due to the idea that
law is designed to defend the elites and oppress the majority), then
there can't be free software.</p>
<p>What's notable about the argument is that it's a pretty dumb. Now since
anarchy ain't mainstream, it seems okay to use the current system to
enforce some form of anarchy by law (use what little you have). GPL
creator himself states that free software (subset of FLOSS) existed in
MIT without requiring licences and then states that it's companies which
refused open access to code, forcing GPL creator (Richard Stallman) to
start a project to develop a truly free Operating System. In an
anarchistic society, there certainly seems to be no motivation to
develop non-FLOSS, but in today's rogue society, there's plenty.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>There's a well-researched document named The Anarchist FAQ (AFAQ)
included in Debian which I spent some time reading. This wasn't a
first-time effort by the way, for the doc is very large. What prompted
the post is the very radical idea contained therein that parents should
encourage their teens to engage in sexual activity, defending such a
position by pointing to evidence that much social decay owes to sexual
taboos. It's really amazing what I read and I haven't been intrigued so
much by a philosophical theory in such a long time. Oh, and by the way,
anarchism is an extremely attractive theory, though I have very many
questions still. I'll keep studying to understand more.</p>
