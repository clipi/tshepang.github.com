    <p>A colleague has since introduced the tool for me, and I use it whenever
I want to do separate commits for uncommited changes, to avoid having to
do the unkool <tt class="docutils literal">git add &lt;filename&gt; &amp;&amp; git commit</tt> dance. I also use it
when I want to commit various hunks separately, and the tool makes that
task real easy.</p>
<p>I was recently impressed by its equivalent functionality for the git
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--amend</span></tt> option. If you click on the <strong>Amend Last Commit</strong> radio
button, it actually displays the commit message of that previous commit.
I was surprised to see it, especially since on clicking that option, I
quickly ran to the command-line to copy that commit message, only to see
the message waiting for me, ready to be edited away.</p>
<p>Another feature I really like is that if you attempt to commit something
without staging it first, instead of just complaining, if offers to
<em>stage and commit</em> all in one click. Nice.</p>
<p>These functionalities are real simple, but they really make for a
pleasant user experience.</p>

<p>When I checked its Debian PTS page, I got surprised by the glaring lack
of bug reports, as well as a small number of Debian releases. I found it
sad when I visited it's <a class="reference external" href="http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=git-cola">popcon page</a> (which is linked from that PTS
page), and got surprised by the low number of installations it has by
Debian users.</p>
