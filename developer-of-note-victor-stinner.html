    <p>Depending on the impact of the change, contributing to open source
software can be intensely challenging. Referring specifically to
CPython, the reference implementation of my favorite programming
language, you can have literally hundreds of messages on the mailing
lists, and at times, many more in the issue tracking system, all
discussing the change in mind. Such changes are most often accompanied
with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/">PEP</a> (Python Enhancement Proposal), a formalised document which
is basically a design spec for the change in mind. It also, helpfully,
summarises the arguments against the change, and addresses them while at
it, which can be of help to those not inclined to consume the
oft-lengthy discussions.</p>
<p>Given all that, it can be quite challenging for any one individual to
champion such important changes, and an example of one such heroic
individual is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haypocalc.com/wiki/Accueil">Victor Stinner</a>, a core CPython developer. He is the
most visible of the guys who helped ensure acceptance of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/">PEP 418</a>,
which proposes some time-related additions and improvements to the
standard library's <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.python.org/library/time">time module</a>. There are many such additions, many a
lot more important than this specific one, but what's most unique about
this one is the sheer amount of discussion that went around this
particular PEP. The mailing list discussions were practically endless,
and so were the updates to the PEP, not to mention the amount of
research involved, which was needed in order to have CPython expose the
new functionality in a cross-platform manner. Now, that's some serious
perseverance.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Looking at his commits, the guy has done a heck of a lot of work in
cleaning up, refactoring, and optimizing the string-handling code. I
can't imagine that this stuff is easy, especially since a large portion
of it is in C, that scary, no-hand-holding language.</p>
