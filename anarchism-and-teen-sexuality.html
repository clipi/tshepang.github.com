    <p>There's a well-researched document named The Anarchist FAQ (AFAQ)
included in Debian which I spent some time reading. This wasn't a
first-time effort by the way, for the doc is very large. What prompted
the post is the very radical idea contained therein that parents should
encourage their teens to engage in sexual activity, defending such a
position by pointing to evidence that much social decay owes to sexual
taboos. It's really amazing what I read and I haven't been intrigued so
much by a philosophical theory in such a long time. Oh, and by the way,
anarchism is an extremely attractive theory, though I have very many
questions still. I'll keep studying to understand more.</p>
