  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Our friendly Debian developer agreed to upload yet another release of
wajig to Debian.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This one is quite special since it now uses Python 3.</li>
<li>It also does automatic dependency installation for DEB files. This
part of the work took me longer because python-apt doesn't exactly
make it easy. I even had to look in the code to be sure what exactly
is happening. I ended up using a mixture of dpkg (for installation of
stated DEBs, and to configure them) and python-apt (for the automatic
installation part).</li>
<li>The WHICHPACKAGE command, which displays which packages the given
file path belongs to, got improved. It was using custom
implementation which was broken for some uses, but there are
available tools (<tt class="docutils literal">dpkg <span class="pre">--list</span></tt> for locally-installed packages and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-file</span> search</tt> for both local and remote packages) that do the
job better, and I made use of them. These tools were probably not
avaialable the time this feature was added to wajig.</li>
