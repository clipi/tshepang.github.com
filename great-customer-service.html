    <p>So these guys at <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-25.776454,28.349731">BMW Bavarian East Pretoria</a> (it has since been closed),
a motorbike dealership, got me impressed with their great customer service.
The standard procedure is to lend customers a bike for a few hours to use
during the day, which normally happens when one takes the bike in for service.
My <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F650CS">F650CS</a> was giving me some trouble which actually perplexed them for
more than those few hours... a few weeks actually.</p>
<p>So why I says they rock:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I wasn't charged for the extra (perhaps dozens) hours of labour.</li>
<li>I was lent a bike (actually 3, since the troubleshooting went for so
long that they needed to sell 2 of those bikes in the meanwhile).</li>
<li>Not sure if I should call this negligence, but there seems to be some
deep trust these guys have for their customers, because no one cared
to check if I could ride the variety of bikes they lent me. That's
gorgeous, especially considering that one of the bikes they lent me was
the superhot <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F800S">BMW F800S</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there is also the element of them encouraging loyalty,
but this still goes beyond the normal &quot;customer is king&quot; routine.</p>
