    <p>Lennart is among the most visible/vocal developers in the GNOME
community, collecting admirers and detracters along the way since he
does not appear afraid of voicing controversial thoughts, or even
express arrogance.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2007-October/msg00136.html">I first heard of him</a> through a project that was to revolutionise Unix
audio, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a>. Using it was not really the best of experiences
(I don't yet need any of its advanced features,
and it consumed too many CPU cybles),
but it may well have just been the way Debian configured it at the time.</p>
<p>Later on, he started work on an init system that was to replace
exisiting ones on Linux-based systems, known as <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/project-of-note-systemd">systemd</a>. This is
among a few FLOSS projects that did genuinely excite me, and for years I
was waiting for it to be Debian default. Sadly, too many issues were
raised, including the refusal of Lennart to support non-Linux systems,
as well as having 'too many features',
way beyond being just a traditional init system, worrying many.</p>
<p>Regardless of the controversy, the fact that Lennart was able to shake
up the FLOSS world with two major projects like this makes him among the
great developers on the planet. He also really put a lot of effort
in his projects, portraying great talent while at, as well managing to market
his projects very well, at least in my eyes.</p>
