  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my previous job</a>, we used to use some Java framework, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mulesoft.org/">Mule ESB</a>,
for our clients. The project is distributed with a lot of jar files,
supposedly for the convenience of users. When we work on a project, we
just add all those jars to the classpath (we use Eclipse, an excessively
powerful and ugly IDE). Now, me being a sucker for the Debian way of
doing things, I'd install packages providing all those jars from a
Debian repository, then remove those Mule-distributed files, then add
symlinks in place of them pointing back to the actualy files. Imagine
how much time it took! Either that, or even easier (but still
time-consuming), skip the symlink thing entirely and just add those jars
(found in <strong>/usr/share/java</strong> directory) directly.</p>
<p>Beyond just wasting time, the are other potential problems with my
approach:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Debian's jar versions did tend to be different to Mule-supplied
versions. You can imagine what problems this can cause, especially
because the versions included there are most likely the ones used for
testing Mule.</li>
<li>Even if the versions were the same, what if there are slight changes
from Debian's side. Debian's strict <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">software guidelines</a> implies
that they'll strip out some stuff that doesn't adhere. The good thing
is that Debian appends <tt class="docutils literal">dfsg</tt> to the version number, but <a class="reference external" href="http://askubuntu.com/q/11592/2591">not
everybody knows that</a>. And even if they did, they would then need to
spend time checking exactly what changed.</li>
<li>Debian doesn't merely re-distribute the jar files. They actually
rebuild them, with Debian-supplied compilers. Maybe this isn't an
issue for Java projects, but who knows.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to knock the Debian way of doing things. It's actually quite
excellent (hence my love), but it can't fit all scenarios. See Matt
Zimmerman's <a class="reference external" href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/07/06/weve-packaged-all-of-the-free-software-what-now/">excellent post</a>, where he touches on this issue.</p>
<p>I did wise up a bit by simply doing things the way the makers of Mule
intended.</p>
