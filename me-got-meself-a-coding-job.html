    <p>I had one of the most exciting moments in my life when I got offered a
job at a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tauspace.com">software development company</a> (the title is Analyst: Software
Engineering). I don't even know what my planned-for tasks are, and I was
all the more surprised because I think I didn't do well at the
interview. Great news is I didn't expect a coding job so soon,
especially given I don't have previous professional exposure.</p>
<p>I am an electronic technician (lesser than an engineer) by trade and am
pretty unhappy in my current job (testing, calibration, and
fault-finding of gyro-stabilised airborne surveillance/observation
systems). That's partly because I don't really get challenged since I'm
on a production line. I do strongly doubt I'd be job-hunting was I in
development/engineering.</p>
<p>Best of all however is I'll be working on software, a dream job really,
considering I love computers and all, and specifically the software part
of it. Electronics is fine too, but the last time I really got close to
it was back in school, and I'm here talking of design, not &quot;testing,
calibration...&quot;.</p>
<p>How lucky can one get!</p>
