            <![CDATA[ <p><strong>notes</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This post was first published on <strong>2012-07-05</strong>,
which is shortly after I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org">liquidluck</a>.</li>
<li>I have a separate post on <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/what-me-loves-about-static-website-generation">what I love about static website generators</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="why-pelican-rocks">
<h2>why <a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org">Pelican</a> rocks</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It has categories
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/163">unlike nikola</a>)</li>
<li>Post metadata:<ul>
<li>if Date is not specified, file mtime is used (unlike <a class="reference external" href="http://blogofile.com">blogofile</a>)</li>
<li>if Category is not specified, parent directory name is used
(unlike blogofile)</li>
<li>titles are allowed to have any character (unlike blogofile)</li>
<li>there is an option to provide clean urls... remove trailing <tt class="docutils literal">.html</tt></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does not force one into having ugly date-based filesystem structure
(<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/vladris/tinkerer/issue/41">unlike tinkerer</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-pelican-rocks-not">
<h2>why Pelican rocks not</h2>
<p>The default theme simply didn't fit my tastes,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/favorite-pelican-themes">the other themes weren't so satisfactory</a>.
I spent way too long fiddling with them, and just couldn't be happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-liquidluck">
<h2>why liquidluck</h2>
<p>So I have moved to <a class="reference external" href="http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org">liquidluck</a>,
and am hoping I will not be 'forced' to move again.
It's way too much work, and it took multiple messages between me and
<a class="reference external" href="http://lepture.com">the developer</a> of this sleek new static site generator just to get it
to behave the way I like it.</p>
<p>I had to override stuff that's done by the software, by using <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src/tip/custom.py">this script</a>,
which helped give it the advantages that Pelican has over the
other generators I mentioned, while also solving the one problem Pelican
has.. lack of a good-enough theme.
This was achieved with the help of that very helpful and responsive developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issues">
<h2>issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">There is no visible way, at least for the default theme, to subscribe
to RSS feeds of individual Categories.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The text is a bit blurry/faint with the default theme,
and none of <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/looking-at-liquidluck-themes">the other ones</a> are close to good-enough for my liking,
all but the promising one named <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bingdian/liquidluck-theme-responsive">responsive</a>.
It got 2 issues so far (see <a class="reference external" href="http://demo-responsive.tshepang.net">live demo</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Date is displayed at the bottom of a post...
why make user scroll that far before presenting such a key piece of info.</li>
<li>There is no link anywhere allowing to visit Home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Background color for <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;code&gt;</tt> text is too unusual,
and results in an ugly look.
It does not fit with the general general theme, so should be grey really,
which would match with that of <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;pre&gt;</tt> text.
I fixed it myself with the following patch:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
diff --git a/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css b/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css
index e90de80..94fa7e8 100644
--- a/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css
+++ b/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css
&#64;&#64; -112,7 +112,7 &#64;&#64; pre {
     border-radius: 3px;
 }
 code, tt {
-    background-color: #fee9cc;
+    background-color: #eee;
     color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
     padding: 1px 3px;
     font-size: 12px;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

            <![CDATA[ <p><strong>notes</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have a separate post on <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/what-me-loves-about-static-website-generation">what I love about static website generators</a>.</li>
<li>This post was first published on <strong>2012-05-20</strong>,
which is before <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/from-pelican-to-liquidluck">I started using liquidluck</a>, a competing tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/">Pelican</a> is a static blog generator;
it converts marked-up text files to html
(Pelican supports <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>).
The resulting site is complete with an index (Archives view),
Tags, Categories, and Pages (for non-bloggy stuff like a CV or About Me file).</p>
<p>As for my blog, its tree structure looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
build/...
pages/{about-me.rst, key-posts.rst}
posts/{arts/, computing/, misc/, movies/}
CNAME
fabfile.py
new-post.py
settings.py
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">build</tt> directory is where the output of the build process is
stored.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">pages</tt> directory is for any content that isn't blog posts.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">posts</tt> directory is where the large chunk of content lives,
the blog posts themselves.
Each of the four directories in there represent a Category, for example:
if you place some file in <tt class="docutils literal">arts/</tt>,
the post will be marked as falling under <strong>arts</strong> Category.</li>
<li>I host my blog on GitHub, using a service the call GitHub Pages.
<tt class="docutils literal">CNAME</tt> is a file required by that service in the case where I want
to use a domain other than <tt class="docutils literal">tshepang.github.io</tt>.
It's content is <tt class="docutils literal">tshepang.net</tt>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog-pelican/src/tip/fabfile.py">fabfile.py</a> contains the build instructions, all for convenience
so that I only need to run 2 commands, one for the build, and another
for GitHub upload. However, I mostly just run one command that does
both.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog-pelican/src/tip/settings.py">settings.py</a> file contains Pelican configuration.
It should be somewhat mostly self-explanatory, but for those things that
aren't so obvious, do consult the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now as for the post itself, you need metadata to go with it.
This is stuff like title, date, and tags.
It can be tedious to create all such mundate stuff, especially the date.
That's why I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog-pelican/src/tip/new-post.py">a script</a> that generates that file and populates it
with the given metadata:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python new-post.py 'my blogging setup' misc --tags blogging
</pre>
<p>This is the metadata, and also the beginning of the file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
my blogging setup
=================

:date: 2012-04-12
:tags: blogging
</pre>
<p>The script also opens the file in my favorite editor,
so I can start adding content.</p>
<p>When I'm done and happy with my latest changes,
I ensure I'm in the root directory of my blog, commit
(<tt class="docutils literal">hg commit <span class="pre">--message</span> 'new post'</tt>) and run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ fab
</pre>
<p>That's a <a class="reference external" href="http://fabfile.org">fabric</a> command the uses the instructions found in <tt class="docutils literal">fabfile.py</tt>.
It builds the site, and then pushes is to GitHub Pages.
It also pushes the sources to Bitbucket.
Within a minute, the blog will be updated.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>It is decent, but the post metadata feels cramped where its placed.</li>
<li>The is no visible link to tags, nevermind a tag cloud (which is handy).</li>
<li>I just don't like the general look.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="simple">

<li>[<strong>win</strong>] displays pages as a list, all but the newest one in the view</li>
<li>Categories are 2nd-class citizens: they aren't shown on the index page</li>
<li>bullets are done wrong: the bulleted text is not indented</li>
<li>on post view, there is no distinction between Tags and Categories</li>
<li>too much border space on code snippets (<strong>pre</strong> tag?)</li>
<li>background for code snippets is not distinctive</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tuxlite-tbs">

<div class="section" id="mockingbird">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wrl/pelican-mockingbird">Mockingbird</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="neat">

<ul class="simple">
<li>[<strong>win</strong>] the look is different; it feels calm</li>
<li>[<strong>win</strong>] the 'moving title' effect is distracting</li>
<li>Archives look like shit (but easy to change)</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="chunk">

            <![CDATA[ <p>Some years ago, I was totally excited by having <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my first job working on
software</a>. I am very grateful for the chance the owner, who interviewed
me for the position, took on me. I learned an incredible amount of
stuff, though I didn't enjoy much of it (had to do lots of Java among
other ugly things).</p>
<p>Some months ago, a friend enticed me to the idea of doing something
else, giving me contacts for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.embedded-iq.com">some company</a> building software and
electronics products for the mining industry. So I wasn't actually
looking for work, but I was glad of the opportunity since I was sort of
stagnating, and it really looked like this new company did some more fun
stuff, and I got the vibe that I'd really get challenged.</p>
<p>It's been 3 months now, and my guess was right. I keep getting surprised
by the levels of smart I encounter regurlarly. These are the sorts of
people I simply can't match with my lesser brain, but I'm glad to work
with, since I learn so much.</p>
<p>The systems we build are embedded, so I spend most of my time working
with C and C++, and it tends to be a serious challenge, given that
there's a lot less hand-holding with those than with my favorite,
Python.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p><strong>update</strong>: The lack of reliability, worst of which was constant
unavailability of my blog lead me to move on, this time to <a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org">Pelican</a>,
and hosted by <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/blogging-with-pelican">Here's the setup</a>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I've been meaning to move my blog(s) away from Posterous, due to its UI
problems and ridiculously-slow page loads. I finally did it with the
help of <a class="reference external" href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a>, which itself has a bunch of problems, which is
forgiveable given that it's a Beta product:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The presentation is way too simple/plain, and doesn't provide a way
to customise it.</li>
<li>I spent hours struggling with Dropbox login integration, where I
often had to go to Chrome's Incognito mode, and at some point, had to
delete my Dropbox account as well, just to get it to work.</li>
<li>It seems crazy that each time I want to publish I have to visit the
web page to hit Publish, when Calepin should simply monitor the
Dropbox account.</li>
<li>The blog is unreachable whenever I publish. This isn't such a big
deal of course, but c'mon.</li>
<li>When hitting Publish, it takes way too long (several seconds) before
the page is rendered on the blog.</li>
<li>...and am sure there will be more as time goes (proven by the fact
that this list kept growing as I typed this post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all these problems, it will have to do for now, until I find
another host, and maybe this time I will have to spend some cash.</p>
<p>In the interest of balance, here's <cite>what attracted me</cite>.</p>

<p>For every drowned and pulseless child rescued by intensive care,
there are many more who don't make it—and not just because their
bodies are too far gone. Machines break down; a team can't get
moving fast enough; a simple step is forgotten. Such cases don't get
written up in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, but they are the norm.
Intensive-care medicine has become the art of managing extreme
complexity—and a test of whether such complexity can, in fact, be
humanly mastered.</p>

<p>That's some scary shit. Read the whole article to get the context
(i.e. the heroic work involved in saving that girl's life).

            <![CDATA[ <p><a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/a-visit-to-eastern-cape">Last time</a>, I raved about my experiences at a friend's home place,
Nyosini. My memory is not to be completely trusted, but this second (or
third, if we count attending <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/one-less-angel">a funeral</a>). one was even better. Such
hospitality is what I'm sure most people on the planet have never
experienced. We (me and two friends, who were just as impressed) were
treated like royalty. We slept there just one night though, so we spent
nearly all our time there in one yard.</p>
<p>I have never seen a family quite like this. My own family is quite
close, but definitely not as kindly as this one. And by the way, there
are no exceptions. The love they have, and express, for each other is...
damn I wish I was a better writer.</p>
<p>I met Bongo again, and the guy's character hasn't changed a bit... maybe
even more shy than last time, I can't tell. Lwazi and Siya weren't there
(boarding school).</p>
<p>One could say it was me (us?) paying homage to that wonderful family
(it's been over 3 years), but also an excuse to go enjoy the warmth of
their welcome, not to mention the gorgeous scenery of the surrounding
hills.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>So these guys at <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-25.776454,28.349731">BMW Bavarian East Pretoria</a> (it has since been closed),
a motorbike dealership, got me impressed with their great customer service.
The standard procedure is to lend customers a bike for a few hours to use
during the day, which normally happens when one takes the bike in for service.
My <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F650CS">F650CS</a> was giving me some trouble which actually perplexed them for
more than those few hours... a few weeks actually.</p>
<p>So why I says they rock:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I wasn't charged for the extra (perhaps dozens) hours of labour.</li>
<li>I was lent a bike (actually 3, since the troubleshooting went for so
long that they needed to sell 2 of those bikes in the meanwhile).</li>
<li>Not sure if I should call this negligence, but there seems to be some
deep trust these guys have for their customers, because no one cared
to check if I could ride the variety of bikes they lent me. That's
gorgeous, especially considering that one of the bikes they lent me was
the superhot <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F800S">BMW F800S</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there is also the element of them encouraging loyalty,
but this still goes beyond the normal &quot;customer is king&quot; routine.</p>

switch, this time to <strong>Posterous</strong> (now-defunct).</p>

<p>As much as I love Tumblr, I got a few complaints:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>performance for some tasks is really bad; the most annoying one is
the time it takes for the Edit button to appear</li>
<li>search is real bad; often it doesn't find stuff I know is there;
sometimes I have to re-run the search before seeing results</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong>: I can't use Markdown to edit them</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong>: I'm not presented with the Edit button at all; I instead
have to do it via the Dashboard, then click Customize, then click
Pages, then scroll and find the page I wanna edit!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/12/17/the-most-reliable-and-unreliable-blogging-services-2/">horrible uptime</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure if these problems will be fixed (I've reported one bug,
without any real feedback). The collective of these problems makes me
wanna search for another blog host. The challenge with the move is doing
the laborious internal re-linking over again.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>There have been many great benefits I got from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org">the Debian project</a>,
but among the most important is my introduction to Anarchism, a radical
political theory that opposes all forms of official hierarchy
(capitalism, communism, religion, etc), arguing that such things tend to
result in oppression.</p>
<p>How I got access to that is via a package known as <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/anarchism">anarchism</a>, a set
of documents formally known as <a class="reference external" href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html">An Anarchist FAQ</a>. It's a very
comprehensive coverage of the theory, and going through it brought both
enlightenment and frustration, for it explained so many things that I
took for granted, while pointing out the causes. The theory is basically
presented as the best possible society humans could ever have.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm not sure if it's actually true, although I lean more
towards it than alternatives (and I haven't read anything extensive on
competing theories, but intuition/experience tells me that capitalism,
communism, and religion all suck tremendously). I need more study to be
more sure, especially because the objections to Anarchism are heavy.</p>
<p>To me it's a scarier concept to introduce yourself as an anarchist than
as an atheist or a homosexual, because the implications are greater. In
fact, they are so great, that the word <em>anarchy</em> itself has been
associated with chaos. That's an expected knee-jerk reaction you'll get
when you punt things like &quot;I reject all forms of official authority,
including all governments!&quot;. But it would be nice if people who shudder
at the concept to spend time with <a class="reference external" href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html">that great document</a>.</p>
<p>My attraction to the theory perhaps is due to my radically liberal
tendencies (EG, I don't see anything wrong with fucking my biological
mother, provided it's consensual, and there's no pregnancy). I don't
know where these tendencies originate, considering that I was a
religious nut back in my early teens, scared of the concept of hell and
similar forms of bullshit.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>This past weekend, I finally went to this neighbouring country of ours,
Botswana. It which was the first time I ever left South Africa. I was
welcomed by wonderful people, and the visit was limited to its largest
city — Gaborone — which is beautiful, sparse, and vast, when compared to
my country's own cities.</p>
<p>One of its residents got shocked when I argued that South Africa doesn't
have a unifying identity, arguing that the country is too diverse to
have such. Instead she argued that such is country's very strength which
led to her pointing out the following wins:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>diverse (and therefore strong) economy; she stated Botswana is
over-reliant on diamonds</li>
<li>diverse tourist attractions; Botswana's tourism is nearly
non-existent in comparison</li>
<li>diverse export market; Botswana is all diamonds, again</li>
<li>press freedom - my input, which she agreed with</li>
<li>high foreign investment</li>
<li>diverse cultures</li>
<li>high media production standards; Botswana has only one tv channel and
the little exposure I got of it expresses amateurish levels of
production</li>
<li>passionate people (highlighting freedom fighters that enabled black
rule; highlighting the toyi-toyi culture)</li>
</ul>
<p>The conversation opened my eyes a little bit, that there's a lot to
appreciate about South Africa. As I talked to more Botswana residents,
and read one critical piece of journalistic writing, Botswana, despite
being far more peaceful and having superior living standards (minimal
crime, kindly people, minimal poverty, far-reaching welfare), has some
serious warts smelly bits: abortion and homosexuality are illegal. I was
shocked by these two, and most especially about the second one. What the
fuck! And that the residents voted for such (the country is apparently
very democratic) proves there's still a lot of work to be done.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>I recently listened to a 2.5 hour-long <a class="reference external" href="http://namb.edgeboss.net/download/namb/audio_files/apologetics_debates/debate-licona_carrier.mp3">debate</a> between two scholars,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carrier">Richard Carrier</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Licona">Mike Licona</a>, which alerted me to the fact that
Jesus' Resurrection is regarded, at least to Christian apologists, to be
very central to the Christian faith (here's <a class="reference external" href="http://agnosticpopularfront.blogspot.com/2004/04/carrier-vs-licona-in-los-angeles-ca.html">an unsatisfactory
review</a>). I became far more impressed with Richard's performance than
Mike's:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mike was the only one who displayed some arrogance (a silly joke here
and a chuckle there, unsuccessfully forcing his opponent to use the
word delusion instead of hallucination, etc.).</li>
<li>Richard was more convincing (and the knowledge he displayed of this
topic is mind-numbing).</li>
<li>He was more clear with his arguments.</li>
<li>He was seemingly more prepared (his opponent probably thought he was
going to be a walkover).</li>
<li>Mike was a bit embarassing at times when mentioning The Passion of
Christ, especially the time when he was praising Jesus (I cringed a
bit there), and Richard, by the way, ignored references to that
movie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these points, I vote for Richard as the winner, with the
disclaimer that the latter part of the debate was getting too technical
for me to follow thoroughly.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>My biggest dream for a long while was becoming a DD (Debian Developer),
but why am I not pursuing that? Let me just say laziness and lack of
motivation, or even lack of focus. There's so many things I want to be
technically proficient at and it's tough to choose one (Python coding,
Debian system admin, GTK+, <a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/">Tracker</a>, Xorg). And there's distractions
all over the place.</p>
<p>Whether I'm going ahead with this is still unresolved so the dream ain't
nearly dead, but the dead dream is that of becoming an academic in some
field. As with FLOSS there's many interesting fields to choose from
(mathematics, electronics, computer science, physics) but I ain't going
any of these routes, most likely because I don't enjoy formal education,
disliking the pressures involved. Hating stress, I would rather pursue
these on my own as I'm doing with FLOSS. Or maybe I'm just a chicken,
afraid of committing! I mean I didn't even finish my university degree
due to similar excuses I mention above. Ah well...</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p><strong>update</strong>: I am not running a business anymore (I gave up trying), and
the major dream mentioned here died with it. So am keeping this here for
its historical value... it's also not bad writing.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I was having a discussion with a colleague over chat software, asking
her about her major dreams. After some deliberations, and after
revealing my own dream of helping a million people, I was touched when
she stated she wanted to open a clinic offering free services as well as
a place to help unemployed mothers. I immediately wished I was rich
enough to grant her the dream.</p>
<p>One reason I asked this question is I'm actually interested in what's in
other people's minds and am often looking for inspiration. Her dream
reminds of a fantasy I once had, like if I had a billion Rands (divide
by ~8 to get US$), what I'd do is build a hospital and fund it for years
on end. That's largely because SA public hospitals generally stink, both
literally and figuratively. And while on that topic, I was recently
discussing with a friend that there were other issues that escalated the
problem before we even talk of insufficient funding: efficiency and
corruption.</p>
<p>While still on the dreaming side of things, someone mentioned that a
dream that truly drives a person is normally ego-driven. Reminds me of a
great dream of becoming a DD (Debian Developer) which <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/unrealized-dreams">kinda died</a>. An
acquaintance also has an ego-driven dream of owning a private medical
lab. He did however admitted that it was a negotiable dream, and that
qualifies it as a fantasy.</p>
<p>While still on medical things, there's yet another acquaintance whose
dream it is to build a clinic of some sort, but I actually forgot the
details. What's interesting however is that when I asked specific
questions like how big it is and some such, she couldn't answer, stating
not having visualised it that far. I have learnt the importance of
visualising a dream thoroughly because that solidifies it pretty well,
helping it get further away from the fantasy category.</p>
<p>Another friend also touched me when he mentioned one dream of setting up
a soup kitchen for homeless people. Noble stuff that.</p>
<p>Dreams are great because focusing on them help reduce the pain of
hardship. They can be as simple as &quot;the salary will help me pay that
debt, and maintain my lifestyle too&quot;, and those are worthwhile dreams
too, at least enough to have millions of displeased workers wake up
every morning to get to work. I've also met quite a number of people
whose main dream is retirement. It used to be my driving passion and
motivator in building my business, but I'm now more driven by what I'll
do with the ample time I'll have at my disposal after that moment, and
even more than that, am driven my the million lives dream (helping a
million people), most especially the ways in which I'll make that
happen: starting worker co-operatives, free IT training, FLOSS
(Free/Libre an Open Source Software) development funding...</p>
<p>Actually noble dreams, the &quot;I want to help improve the world&quot; sort, are
my favorites and I always get excited when someone mentions such, not
those of &quot;I want to have this house and that car&quot;. I probably am
dishonest with myself, but as much as I drool at the sight and thought
of a Bentley Continental GT, pumping the retail cost of that beauty into
feeding a 100 hungry kids for a month is more my thing. I do of course
have non-noble dreams: travelling Africa and the world for fun,
acquiring a decent entertainment system and a serious gaming PC (am I a
sucker for hardware-pushing high-end games!), visit international film
festivals (am I a sucker for movies!), and even produce some short
movies, preferably animated, preferably with FLOSS (I am a
politically-charged wannabe!).</p>
<p>A friend of mine, a sports sucker, wants to sponsor one kid to go
professional in that field. Having loved to have had such an opportunity
as a kid, he wants to ensure some deserving kid doesn't meet the same
fate (and end up in career s/he dislikes). I know at least two other
highly-gifted people who didn't further their sporting careers due to
lack of support (likely financial). That's painful actually and
shouldn't happen to anyone. Another friend of mine wants to open a
dancing facility to help get kids off the streets. I'm not sure if
that's a negotiable dream or not (it didn't sound like a priority item,
neither did the sports sponsorship thing by the way) but we are to find
out in due time...</p>
<p>A brother of mine, a gifted and multi-talented (composer, producer,
arranger, mixer, vocalist, sound engineer, writer) musician, wants to
help groom and promote a number of small-time artists. That would really
help in an industry where talent isn't enough to propel one further.
Also, this is in an industry where too many lacking that talent are
propelled forward regardless.</p>

job at a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tauspace.com">software development company</a> (the title is Analyst: Software
Engineering). I don't even know what my planned-for tasks are, and I was
all the more surprised because I think I didn't do well at the
interview. Great news is I didn't expect a coding job so soon,
especially given I don't have previous professional exposure.</p>
<p>I am an electronic technician (lesser than an engineer) by trade and am
pretty unhappy in my current job (testing, calibration, and
fault-finding of gyro-stabilised airborne surveillance/observation
systems). That's partly because I don't really get challenged since I'm
on a production line. I do strongly doubt I'd be job-hunting was I in
development/engineering.</p>
<p>Best of all however is I'll be working on software, a dream job really,
considering I love computers and all, and specifically the software part
of it. Electronics is fine too, but the last time I really got close to
it was back in school, and I'm here talking of design, not &quot;testing,
calibration...&quot;.</p>
<p>How lucky can one get!</p>

and what prompted me to post is the following snippet which states the
advantages of being friendly towards customers:</p>
<blockquote>
...It reminds me of independent booksellers, who said &quot;why should I
make it comfortable for people to read books in my store? I want
them to buy the books!&quot; And then one day Barnes and Nobles puts
<em>couches</em> and <em>cafes</em> in the stores and practically <em>begged</em> people
to read books in their store without buying them. Now you've got all
these customers sitting in their stores for <em>hours</em> at a time,
mittengrabben all the books with their filthy hands, and the
probability that they find something they want to buy is linearly
proportional to the amount of time they spend in the store, and even
the dinkiest Barnes and Nobles superstore in Iowa City rakes in
hundreds of dollars a <em>minute</em> while the independent booksellers are
going out of business. Honey, Shakespeare and Company on Manhattan's
Upper West Side did <em>not</em> close because Barnes and Nobles had
cheaper prices, it closed because Barnes and Nobles had <em>more human
beings in the building</em>.</blockquote>
<p>I used to frequent some local book/magazine franchise whose merchandise
I liked but just couldn't afford.
That made the experience uncomfortable, the risk of being told to leave.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>I normally dislike documentaries which tend to be dumbed-down,
over-emphasizing certain concepts, and worse still, treated with
over-dramatic music and other cinematic touches like re-enactments and
camera play. That's why Part 1 of Imagination: A Short History of Tall
Buildings, happens to be quite a relief, since it turns to be of mild
presentation with excellent use of music, apart from also being a very
effective piece in its primary purpose of providing information. It
actually brings again to life my love for high-rises which, in my
memory, really began when I saw a tremendously gorgeous picture of the
Manhattan skyline, with the twin towers at the center, an image I found
in World Book Encyclopedia back in 1995. That image made me fall in love
with those twin towers, which to me were the most interesting structures
in all of New York, such that I still don't understand why I hear that
many didn't like the structures, the reason for which I still have to
find out.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>I was reading some old Debian posts where there was an argument brewing
regarding the existence of anarchy within Debian. A notable point raised
was that the existence of the GPL, the leading FLOSS licence, was
impossible because a licence's existence requires laws to exist. The
argument was that, since anarchy is against law (due to the idea that
law is designed to defend the elites and oppress the majority), then
there can't be free software.</p>
<p>What's notable about the argument is that it's a pretty dumb. Now since
anarchy ain't mainstream, it seems okay to use the current system to
enforce some form of anarchy by law (use what little you have). GPL
creator himself states that free software (subset of FLOSS) existed in
MIT without requiring licences and then states that it's companies which
refused open access to code, forcing GPL creator (Richard Stallman) to
start a project to develop a truly free Operating System. In an
anarchistic society, there certainly seems to be no motivation to
develop non-FLOSS, but in today's rogue society, there's plenty.</p>
