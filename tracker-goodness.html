    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/">Tracker</a> hasn't been around as long as Beagle has but seems more
advanced, possessing various utilities like the applet which can be used
to launch all Tracker GUI utilities (Tracker Search Tool, Tracker
Preferences, and Tracker Statistics), displaying the daemon (trackerd)
status, providing the functionality of pausing the Tracker daemon, as
well as providing a (convenient) search dialogue [<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/more-tracker-goodness">update</a>]. I wonder
if Beagle has lovely tools like this, but it's main advantage is that it
supports far more data formats that Tracker does, while it still is
hungry for memory (version 0.3.2).</p>
<p>One particular thing that encouraged this post however is Tracker
Statistics, when I discovered that it actually is self-updating. This
change, which I apparently missed, was committed October last year, and
got me really impressed. Now if only all those advanced options were
less buggy...</p>
<p>While I'm at it I might as well mention how much I love the new Tracker
Preferences feature which makes it restart/reindex user's data depending
on what preferences were changed. That's gorgeous. Now if only it
performed such restarting/reindex faster than it often does (especially
when it is indexing), since one often has to wait 'forever' for such to
happen.</p>
