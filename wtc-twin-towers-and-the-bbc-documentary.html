    <p>I normally dislike documentaries which tend to be dumbed-down,
over-emphasizing certain concepts, and worse still, treated with
over-dramatic music and other cinematic touches like re-enactments and
camera play. That's why Part 1 of Imagination: A Short History of Tall
Buildings, happens to be quite a relief, since it turns to be of mild
presentation with excellent use of music, apart from also being a very
effective piece in its primary purpose of providing information. It
actually brings again to life my love for high-rises which, in my
memory, really began when I saw a tremendously gorgeous picture of the
Manhattan skyline, with the twin towers at the center, an image I found
in World Book Encyclopedia back in 1995. That image made me fall in love
with those twin towers, which to me were the most interesting structures
in all of New York, such that I still don't understand why I hear that
many didn't like the structures, the reason for which I still have to
find out.</p>
