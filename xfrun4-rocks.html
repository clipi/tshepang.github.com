    <p>The one desktop environment I live in is GNOME, which also happens to be
my favorite too. It's got quite a lot of things that can be better of
course and one of them is its run dialog. I once bumped into
that run dialog of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce 4</a> and have used it since I discovered it <a class="reference external" href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/2007-February/msg00003.html">years
ago</a>. What I like about it is, unlike GNOME's, it doesn't auto-complete
using a large list of possible commands (presumably on the shell's PATH)
but rather a smaller list consisting of commands I have actually run
previously. What's more is that it makes those commands persistently
available as history (which GNOME's does as well by the way). As if
that's not enough, it will store only commands that were successfully
launched to avoid storing typos and failed commands in history. These
features makes for a superb piece of software.</p>
