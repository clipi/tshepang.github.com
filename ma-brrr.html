    <p>We all know that each repeat viewing of a movie is a different
experience. You can say the same with a stage play, except that it's
never the same thing. I'm here referring to MaBrr (there is not even one
credible site I found with a few minutes of search), a musical play
currently seen at State Theatre, Pretoria. It's about the life and
career of Brenda Fassie, a deceased South African vocalist, who was
arguably the most popular of the country's artist in history.</p>
<p>The first night was the best experience I've so far had in my stage play
experience. It was electrifying and the audience agreed with me. A few
goosebumps here and there. It's amazing how larger-than-life one person
can be made. It brought a new appreciation of South African art (and
abilities), that there's such a rich culture to export.</p>
<p>So what are some the elements that made me so excited, the first time
around:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lead performance: I gained new-found respect for Lesego Motsepe, who
is famous for her long career in Isidingo, a soapie generally
regarded as South Africa's best; the director even mentioned that
someone stated that she wasn't LIKE Brenda, but rather, she WAS
Brenda; the result of the voice training she went through was
amazing, because she really sounded like her character</li>
<li>music: the compositions were remixed, and the live band bringing it
alive rocked; I wish it would get recorded because some of it were
improvements on the originals</li>
<li>dancers: though the dancing merely okay, their energy was tops,
especially the guys, and the quality of the choreography also helped</li>
<li>costume design: what the dancers had to wear was mostly impressive,
and often offered an accurate display of dressing styles through a
bit of South Africa's past</li>
<li>backing vocalists: wonderful, notably the fat guy, who had a tiny
moment to act, which was hilarious</li>
<li>extra emotion: well, Bongani Fassie, Brenda's son, pitched on stage
unscheduled, and even joined the lead performer to sing &quot;Too Late for
Mama&quot;</li>
<li>miscellaneous: a bunch of scenes and moments are too many to mention</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that this was opening night may have helped a lot, as well as
close to sold-out venue. Now, the shitty thing about stage is that such
moments can't be replicated, and even though it may have been recorderd,
it's just not the same.</p>
<p>The revisit was something else. The attendance was really bad this time
around (a Thursday after Friday's opening night):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lead performance: she was probably tired and/or discouraged by the
small and unresponsive crowd; she mostly didn't even try to sound
like Brenda</li>
<li>music: there's wasn't a degradation, so kudos!</li>
<li>dancing: less energy, and that there were fallen beads on stage
probably didn't help</li>
<li>costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here</li>
<li>backing vocalists: wonderful, but the fat guy was just reciting his
words this time</li>
<li>extra emotion: well, the Bongani Fassie thing can't be replicated</li>
<li>miscellaneous: no surprises, nothing new worth mentioning</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="update">
<h2>update</h2>
<p>I went to see this for the third time, this time on a Saturday, so the
audience was much bigger than last time, and the show was far better,
making me a little bit obsessed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lead performance: she did better than last time, but maybe not as
good as the first night</li>
<li>music: I recall enjoying the previous moments better, maybe because I
got used to it</li>
<li>dancing: the energy seemed as high as the first time around, and I
enjoyed it more (I really the supercool guys at the jazz club)</li>
<li>costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here</li>
<li>backing vocalists: the nice fat guy was replaced by a less
interesting one</li>
<li>extra emotion: I kept getting (unbearable) attention from one dancer,
since I was on the front row seats; I guess she wanted to steal the
show, and I didn't allow her (she was unrelenting) so I shifted my
attention away</li>
<li>miscellaneous: the kids called up on stage were much more fun than on
previous occasions</li>
</ul>
