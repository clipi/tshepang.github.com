  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Excellence in the track concerned contributes to the magnificence
of its video. I'm a fan of nearly all the following tracks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Next Movement</strong> (The Roots)
The odd positions that our stars take and the overall beauty of it
makes it an eternal favourite of mine,
not to mention fact that the track is among my hip-hop favourites.
The simplicity of the video contributes and so is the fact it
remains entertaining despite that it's shot in just one room,
which is the kind of inventiveness I admire in art.</li>
<li><strong>That Thing</strong> (Lauryn Hill)
Flawlessly merges the views of two eras on one screen.</li>
<li><strong>Got Till It's Gone</strong> (Janet Jackson)
Great direction and cinematography as well as the casting makes
this an eternal masterpiece.</li>
<li><strong>Stranger in Moscow</strong> (Michael Jackson; Director - Nick Brandt)
Among the best camerawork and editing with magnificent slow-motion
scenes.. towards perfection.</li>
<li><strong>The Sixth Sense</strong> (Common)
Excellently capturing an unexplained event which looks like some
sort of chaos, causing looks of despair and wonder among the
characters conecerned, some catching it on tv,
some near the event... powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Everything is Everything</strong> (Lauryn Hill)
Great VFX showcasing NYC as a turntable are hard to beat.</li>
<li><strong>Hey Ya</strong> (OutKast)
The high energy the video invokes, the appeal of seeing
a member of OutKast perform, and the VFX makes for an
exciting experience.</li>
<li><strong>Respiration</strong> (Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli feat. Common)
Beautiful images of them great rappers strutting their style enhanced
shot by the black and style camerawork with some wonderful busy city
images.</li>
<li><strong>Egumnandini</strong> (Doc Shebeleza)
Few videos were aver able to capture the township party scene with
such energy and believability. The cinematography is quite good too.</li>
<li><strong>Who We Be</strong> (DMX)
I usually like DMX's music videos because of their craftsmanship and the
messages they portray -- staying away from the annoying booty-shows
that so many succesful other rappers employ. This one is armed with
some excellent editing, some good visual effects, and some real-life
footage all put in the mix.</li>
<li><strong>Love of My Life</strong> (Erykah Badu)
Erykah Badu's perfomance, as is the case in her videos, draws
one's attention, despite a huge anti-climactic slow-down in
the middle of the song.</li>
<li><strong>All 'n my Grill</strong> (Missy Elliot)
This could have been higher in the ratings had its mighty New York
settings -- with the dark lighting and that famous yellow-taxi
scenery -- not been interrupted by the boring dancing that Missy
likes so much in her videos.</li>
<li><strong>Feel It Boy</strong> (Beenie Man ft. Janet Jackson; Dir: Dave Meyers)
Gorgeous, mellow, and digitally-manipulated envionment which offers rare
warmth. It boasts perhaps the largest collection of gorgeous gals of any
music video I've seen. Jackson doesn't look comfortable though, with
unnatural poses.</li>
</ol>
