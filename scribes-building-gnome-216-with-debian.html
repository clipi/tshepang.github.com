  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In order to minimize bandwidth usage, I have recently restricted myself
to building a local repository consisting only of source packages as
opposed to the previous times when I only did binary package downloads.
This was helped by my recently-acquired skill of building Debian
packages from source, most often just 3 simple commands:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">build-dep</span> nautilus</tt> (retrieves nautilus' build
dependencies)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo <span class="pre">apt-get</span> source <span class="pre">--build</span> nautilus</tt> (downloads nautilus' source
into current directory and builds a Debian binary package out of it)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo dpkg <span class="pre">--install</span> *deb</tt> (installs the .deb files stated on the
command line onto the system)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've been practicing the above procedure on several packages, including
monsters like Linux, GLibC and OpenOffice.org, and it worked pretty
well.</p>
<p>I did the same for GNOME 2.16/2.18 packages (Debian GNOME maintainers
haven't completed the job of migrating to 2.18 yet) available in
Debian's <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.debian.org/experimental/">Experimental repository</a>. This effort was initially targetted
at building 2.16 version of python-gnome and 2.10 version of python-gtk2
in order to try to build Scribes, after a previous failure. But then,
since I had much GNOME infrastructure (libgtk2, libbonono, libgnomevfs2,
...) already built, I proceeded on building some of my favorites as well
(nautilus, gnome-terminal, gedit, etc.), and, even though I only had ~3
hours of sleep, I woke up a happy being.</p>
<p>I almost forgot to mention that Scribes managed to run properly, though
I didn't have enough time to check it out properly. It sure looks good
and am looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>[a day later]</strong></p>
<p>Although I managed to get <a class="reference external" href="http://scribes.sourceforge.net/index.html">Scribes</a> to hang at least once, here's the
more positive facts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I really do love the auto-save feature</li>
<li>the interface is real clean, providing a fresh departure from the
stately (and beloved) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/">gedit</a></li>
<li>it's got word-suggestion by default</li>
<li>there's some other nifty nice features like various editing
capabilities which are far more powerful than gedit provides</li>
</ul>
