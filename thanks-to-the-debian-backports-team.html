  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So I got this new HP laptop, Probook 4530s, and installed Debian 6
(Squeeze) on it. I was left sitting with two unbearable problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The touchpad wasn't fully operational (GNOME Mouse Preferences didn't
have a Touchpad tab where I could change the settings).</li>
<li>The video driver seemed to have a problem according to the output of
<strong>xvinfo</strong> (<tt class="docutils literal">no adaptors present</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I curiously looked at <a class="reference external" href="http://backports.debian.org/">the backports</a>, and found Linux kernel 2.6.38
(Squeeze has 2.6.32). I didn't expect much from it, but installed it
anyway (I heard that it has improved desktop responsiveness). I was
pleasantly surprised to find that it fixed the above two problems.
Loveliness.</p>
<p>On another note, I found that Mercurial 1.8 also has a backport.
This is great news because I have repositories I created with that
version and the format is incompatible with Squeeze's 1.6.</p>
