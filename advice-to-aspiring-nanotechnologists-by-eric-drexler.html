<blockquote>
Software systems will be vital to nanotechnology and to enabling
technologies along the way. A basic introduction to computers and
software will be of value to anyone in any area of science or
technology. Those interested in software related to nanotechnology
should pay special attention to numerical simulation methods for
molecular mechanical and quantum electronic systems, and to the
design of programs for highly parallel computer systems, since this
is the direction hardware will be moving in the coming years.
Parallel systems will help designers develop nanotechnology, and
nanocomputers will later be used to build massively parallel
(trillion processor and up) computer systems. Finally, if powerful
systems are to be useful in molecular design, they will need to be
accessible through fast, clean, intuitive interfaces that let
designers see and manipulate model molecules.</blockquote>
<p>The great Eric Drexler offers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/engines-of-creation-20-advice-to-aspiring-nanotechnologists">extensive guidance</a> for those
considering studying towards molecular nanotech, and that quote is most
relevant to me, since I'm doing software and all.</p>
<p>The end-notes, where he encourages supreme rigour and discipline, would
scare most away. This appears to be a demanding career.</p>
