    <p>I respect a lot of software developers, but many of those are not
going to have an entry in this series, and not because they are lesser
in my eyes.</p>
<p>Here's the criteria I use to regard someone as <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/tags#developer-of-note-ref">developer of the
note</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I need a news item that would trigger a post.
Thing is, if you write about someone,
you actually need to have some content (duh!),
and saying &quot;Guide van Rossum rocks for creating Python, and am grateful!&quot;
is simply not enough, hence a need for a trigger.
In fact, I used to call this series <em>developer of the moment</em>,
but at some point felt that the new name is more fitting,
especially since a few of these honorable developers actually generated
some new triggers along the way.</li>
<li>The more obvious requirement is that the developer need to have done
some thing that I truly appreciate.
At times, I fail to put into words just how much.</li>
</ul>
