        <p>I am a big fan of the series, <em>Person of Interest</em>. There is much to
celebrate, among which is the wonderful portrayal of the brilliant
creator of the machine that (illegally) looks for patterns in society
so as to predict, with high certainty, the people will be involved in
violent crimes, either as victims or perpetrators.</p>
<p>The series' normal formula is that our heroic, bespectacled hero would
mention the details of the new person, and his very capable sidekick,
a former assassin, would go follow this person, to try avert the
impending crime. In the 16th episode of the 2nd season, however, this
formula isn't followed (by the camera). Instead we follow the person
who would be victim, and our heroes only appear midway through, like
they were secondary characters. It's beautiful.</p>
<p>I love it when such breaks from normal routine occur, especially when
they are as well-made. Not to say this is the best episode of this
series so far (I can think of a few which were superior), nor was this
the first time such a break from normal routine occur (there were some
in the earlier episodes of the season), but it felt fresh enough to be
worth a mention in this blog of mine. What added to the excitement is
that it was the first time in the series that a so-called Relevant[#]
crime prevention was showed.</p>
