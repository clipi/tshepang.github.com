        <p>I have been using an Acer TravelMate 6592 laptop for close to 3 years
(ever since I got <a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/me-got-meself-a-coding-job">my coding job</a>). It had some issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.co.za/search?hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=630&amp;q=6592+acer&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">it's damn ugly</a>, though not as much as Lenovo ones</li>
<li>it requires Intel non-free firmware for its Wi-Fi chipset</li>
<li>it frequently refused to make the LAN accessible from Linux on boot;
this was likely a BIOS issue</li>
<li>the battery capacity was below 50% so it didn't last</li>
<li>the hard drive was developing bad sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, it truly was an excellent laptop, and I never
complained about its performance, ever since I added a 2GB RAM stick, to
make it a total of 4GB (except that I wished my HDD was faster, tempting
me to buy an SSD). What else I really liked about it is the
feature-packed touchpad: Beyond the normal two-finger and
side-scrolling, it also had up-down-left-right buttons which allowed
constant-speed scrolling. It's interesting that such a touchpad is very
rare.</p>
<p>I now got an HP Probook 4530s and its pros:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=probook+4530s&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=630">it's stunning</a></li>
<li>it's got a real fast hard drive; there were times when I saw speeds
upwards to 70MB/s, which I never saw with the older laptop</li>
<li>its Wi-Fi doesn't require non-free software</li>
<li>it's far more modern (USB3 support) and supposedly faster (Core
i5-2410M vs. Core 2 Duo T7500), but my typical workload made even the
TravelMate more than adequate</li>
</ul>
<p>And the cons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a less featureful touchpad</li>
<li>keyboard keys placed in weird locations (e.g. <strong>pg up</strong> and <strong>pg dn</strong>
buttons are placed far away, at the top-right corner; I blame the
(needless for me) numeric keypad</li>
<li>the screen resolution is on the low side and so is the screen size;
the older laptop is much bigger even if they are both labeled 15.4&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>...and Debian:</p>
<p>Quite a few times, I tend to want to stick to a stable release of
Debian. Following Debian development does take time (frequent updates,
curiosity to see what changed, and something getting broken here and
there). So I tried to do the same here. Sadly, some of the software in
Squeeze is too outdated to be optimal, so am glad to have teams like
<a class="reference external" href="http://tshepang.net/thanks-to-the-debian-backports-team">Debian Backports folk</a>. But that wasn't enough, so I ended up
installing Xorg components from Debian Unstable (Suspend doesn't work
well with Squeeze (Debian 6) and backports doesn't have a newer X
version.</p>
<p>Let's see how long I last trying to keep pure by running as little from
outside Squeeze as possible.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>:</p>
<p>This didn't even last for 1 day. I was having issues with my X hanging
the entire OS, forcing me to do a hard-reboot. This happened when I was
watching a video using VLC, so I blamed it and installed the version
from Debian Unstable. Sadly, doing things that way resulted in a VLC
that refused to die normally, forcing me to do <tt class="docutils literal">kill <span class="pre">-9</span> vlc</tt>. I then
just screwed my plans and upgraded fully to Unstable, and now VLC quits
gracefully. Let's see if I'll have the X lockup again.</p>
<p><strong>update 2</strong>:</p>
<p>Well, I still experience machine lock-ups, the bad ones forcing a
hard-reboot. This might be related to Wi-Fi because I used the system
for quite a while using the wired link, without any such lock-up.</p>
<p><strong>update 3</strong>:</p>
<p>No more lock-ups, except very rarely. I run a mix of Testing and
Unstable at the moment, but my &quot;/etc/sources.list&quot; file points solely at
my custom repository and Testing, for it just is tiring to keep tracking
Unstable... way too much bandwidth.</p>
