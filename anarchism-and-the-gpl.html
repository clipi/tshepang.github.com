  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was reading some old Debian posts where there was an argument brewing
regarding the existence of anarchy within Debian. A notable point raised
was that the existence of the GPL, the leading FLOSS licence, was
impossible because a licence's existence requires laws to exist. The
argument was that, since anarchy is against law (due to the idea that
law is designed to defend the elites and oppress the majority), then
there can't be free software.</p>
<p>What's notable about the argument is that it's a pretty dumb. Now since
anarchy ain't mainstream, it seems okay to use the current system to
enforce some form of anarchy by law (use what little you have). GPL
creator himself states that free software (subset of FLOSS) existed in
MIT without requiring licences and then states that it's companies which
refused open access to code, forcing GPL creator (Richard Stallman) to
start a project to develop a truly free Operating System. In an
anarchistic society, there certainly seems to be no motivation to
develop non-FLOSS, but in today's rogue society, there's plenty.</p>
