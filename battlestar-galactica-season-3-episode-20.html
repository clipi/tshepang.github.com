    <p>I hardly ever write anything about tv productions regardless of how many
times I tend to get impressed, and there hasn't been a shortage of that.
That's mainly due to laziness/motivation, but this time I just have to
mention this one gem:</p>
<p>The very last episode of the Season mainly focuses on the trial of one
former president who is accused of treason due to surrendering to the
cylons (a species created by humans) as well as giving them official
approval to execute dozens of people. The defence given by an assistant
lawyer is a masterpiece, and would match well with any court thing I've
seen in my tv/movie-watching history. The performance matches as well,
and that's interesting because the performer/character combination is
among the least interesting in the series.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, I find this Season to be the best (in a series of
four), because it covers more interesting events (the capturing of the
humans, the resistance, their eventual rescue, and a lot more, best of
which was the trial of course).</p>
<p>This positiveness could make it look like I'm a huge fan of the series,
but I'm not. In fact, I too often tend to hate it. There's a whole lot
of religious non-sense that I can't bear, some seriously annoying
characters, at least overly eccentric one, too much day-dreaming, some
too-stupid plot decisions... but Episode 20 goes some way to help me
forgive the rest of the shit.</p>
